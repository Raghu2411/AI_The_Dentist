**ORAL PANORAMIC X-RAY EXAMINATION REPORT**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 32 teeth are visualized, with all anatomical structures and dental crowns fully erupted. All four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) are present and not impacted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Tooth #12 (FDI 12)**: Suspected calculus deposition noted at the root apices, with radiopaque density changes.  
- **Area near tooth #16 (FDI 16)**: Areas of concern for early carious lesion identified lateral to the mesial root, consistent with a small radiolucent shadow.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Suspected calculus on #12**: Requires further clinical evaluation to confirm presence and extent.  
2. **Caries suspicion near #16**: Early carious involvement warrants close monitoring to prevent progression.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce biofilm control through improved interproximal brushing and flossing techniques.  
- Schedule professional scaling for suspected calculus on #12 to mitigate periodontal risk.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to periodontist**: For assessment of calculus on #12 and potential instrumentation.  
- **6-month recall**: To reassess the carious lesion near #16 using clinical and radiographic correlation.  
- **Oral hygiene counseling**: Focus on high-risk areas, including the mesial aspect of #16.
