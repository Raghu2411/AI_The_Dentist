**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 27 teeth are visualized within the field of view, including the presence of both upper right (tooth #18) and upper left (tooth #48) wisdom teeth, which are fully erupted and not impacted. No evidence of prior tooth extraction is observed.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Caries**:  
  - Suspicious for caries on #26 (upper right first molar) and #17 (lower right second premolar).  
  - Areas of concern noted for potential caries near tooth #12 (lower left second premolar).  
- **Calculus**:  
  - Suspected calculus deposits on #11 (lower left first premolar).  
- **Root Stumps**:  
  - Suspicious for root stumps near tooth #23 (upper right first molar) and #37 (upper left third molar).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorations, root canal treatments, or implants are observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Deep caries suspicion on #26 and #17**: Requires evaluation for restorative intervention.  
2. **Root stumps near #23 and #37**: Further radiographic assessment recommended to confirm presence of residual roots.  
3. **Calculus deposits on #11**: Reinforcement of professional scaling or home plaque control.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce patient education on plaque removal techniques, particularly for #11.  
- Monitor suspicious areas of potential caries on #12 and #17 during routine recall visits.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule a 6-month recall for monitoring of carious lesions and calculus management.  
- Referral to endodontist for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning of suspected root stumps (#23, #37).  
- Consider bitewing radiographs for confirmation of carious involvement on #26 and #17.
