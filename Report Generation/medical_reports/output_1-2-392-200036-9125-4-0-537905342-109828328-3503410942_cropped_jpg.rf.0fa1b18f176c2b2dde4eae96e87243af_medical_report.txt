**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
**Priority Concerns**  
- Impacted tooth near #27 requires evaluation for potential surgical removal.  
- Existing root canal-treated teeth near #14, #17, and #27 necessitate monitoring for secondary caries or apical pathologies.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols around impacted #27 and near-treated areas (#14, #17, #27, #35).  
- Emphasize regular interdental cleaning to mitigate periodontal risks around restored teeth.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral**: Consult an oral surgeon for assessment of impacted #27.  
- **Recall**: Schedule 6-month follow-up to monitor restorations and impacted site.  
- **Endodontic Review**: Reassess root canal-treated teeth (#14, #17, #27) at the next recall for signs of failure.
