**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 30 teeth are visualized. Wisdom teeth (#18 and #28) are present and **not impacted**. No evidence of dental implants, crowns, or root canal treatments is observed.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Calculus deposits**:  
  - **Suspicious for calculus** noted on #12, #13, and #21 (areas of concern for mineralized biofilm).  
- **Suspicious for caries**: A small radiolucent lesion is observed **near tooth #27** (interproximal region).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorations, crowns, or endodontic treatments are detected.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Caries suspicion near #27**: Immediate evaluation required to confirm carious involvement and prevent progression.  
2. **Calculus deposits on #12, #13, #21**: Indicates localized plaque accumulation necessitating professional scaling.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene practices, emphasizing interdental cleaning (flossing or interdental brushes) for affected quadrants.  
- Monitor calculus-prone areas during routine hygiene visits.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule a **6-month recall** for professional scaling and reevaluation of calculus deposits.  
- Reassess the suspicious carious lesion near #27 with targeted radiographs or visual examination.  
- Consider referral to a periodontist for calculus management if biofilm control remains suboptimal.
