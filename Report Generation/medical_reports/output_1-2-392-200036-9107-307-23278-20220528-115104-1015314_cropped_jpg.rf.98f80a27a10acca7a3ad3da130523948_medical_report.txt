**Oral Radiological Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

**General Condition**  
A total of 23 teeth are visualized with acceptable clarity. The lower right wisdom tooth (#48) is fully erupted and non-impacted. No evidence of congenital absence or supernumerary teeth is observed.  

**Pathological Findings**  
1. **Tooth #27**: Suspected carious lesion noted.  
2. **Near tooth #15**: Areas of concern for carious demineralization at the distal surface.  
3. **Near tooth #44**: Periapical radiolucency observed, suggesting possible apical periodontitis or inflammatory changes.  

**Historical Interventions**  
1. **Tooth #48**: Root canal-treated tooth with definitive radiographic evidence.  
2. **Near tooth #21**: Presence of a composite restoration.  
3. **Near tooth #16**: Amalgam restoration detected.  
4. **Near tooth #25**: Indirect restoration (inlay/onlay) noted.  
5. **Near tooth #35**: Combination of a root canal-treated tooth and a full-coverage crown.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
1. **Suspected caries on #27** requires urgent evaluation for restorative intervention.  
2. **Demineralization near #15** necessitates further diagnostic imaging (e.g., bitewing) to confirm extent.  
3. **Periapical radiolucency near #44** warrants endodontic assessment to rule out apical pathology.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce meticulous oral hygiene practices, particularly interproximal cleaning around #15 and #27.  
- Monitor suspicious areas for progression of demineralization.  
- Advise dietary counseling to minimize cariogenic risks.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for re-evaluation of carious lesions and periapical changes.  
- **Referral to endodontist** for #44 and #15 to confirm diagnosis and treatment planning.  
- **Referral to restorative specialist** for permanent restoration of #27 if caries is confirmed.
