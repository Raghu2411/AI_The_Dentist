**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 21 teeth are visualized, with the following distribution:  
- Maxillary arch: 11 teeth (#11, #12, #13, #16, #17, #22, #23, #25, #27).  
- Mandibular arch: 10 teeth (#31, #32, #33, #34, #35, #41, #42, #43, #44, #45, #46, #48).  
Wisdom teeth: Only the right mandibular wisdom tooth (#48) is present and fully erupted, with no evidence of impaction.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Sign of a root stump** noted near tooth #22.  
2. **Suspicious areas of caries** identified near:  
   - Tooth #25 (low confidence).  
   - Tooth #45 (low confidence).  
   - Tooth #16 (very low confidence).  
   - Tooth #13 (very low confidence).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **Presence of a restoration** adjacent to tooth #13.  
2. **Root canal-treated tooth** with a **crown** on tooth #35.  
3. **Crown placement** observed near tooth #27.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **Root stump near #22**: Requires clinical correlation to determine if residual apical tissue remains.  
- **Suspected early caries**: Near #25, #45, #16, and #13. Prioritize radiographic and tactile examination to confirm.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interproximal cleaning near #25 and #45.  
- Monitor suspicious cariogenic areas with follow-up imaging and recall.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for reassessment of carious lesions and root stump.  
- **Referral to endodontist** for evaluation of #35’s root canal treatment success.  
- **Dental caries management** for #25 and #45: Consider preventive resin restorations or sealants if non-cavitated.
