**Teeth-Specific Observations**  

1. **General Condition**  
   A total of 22 teeth are visualized. No wisdom teeth (third molars) are present bilaterally. The overall dental arch appears intact with no evidence of supernumerary teeth.  

2. **Pathological Findings**  
   - **Sign of root stumps** near tooth **#35** and **#27** (definitive).  
   - **Suspected root stumps** near tooth **#17** (confidence < 0.80).  
   - **Areas of concern noted for caries** near tooth **#24** and **#25** (low confidence).  
   - **Suspected periapical radiolucency** near tooth **#35** (low confidence).  

3. **Historical Interventions**  
   - **Root canal-treated (rc-treated)** teeth confirmed near **#45** and **#15**.  
   - **Restoration** present near **#45** (likely composite or amalgam).

**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

1. **Priority Concerns**  
   - **Root stumps near #35 and #27** suggest prior extractions or failed endodontic treatments; clinical correlation required.  
   - **Caries near #24 and #25** require further evaluation for potential restoration or preventive intervention.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Reinforce oral hygiene protocols to mitigate progression of suspicious carious lesions.  
   - Monitor areas of concern near #24, #25, and #17 during routine follow-ups.  

3. **Follow-up Protocol**  
   - **6-month recall** to reassess periapical status of #35 and progression of caries.  
   - **Referral to endodontist** for treatment planning of root stumps near #35 and #27.  
   - **Radiographic review** of #45 restoration for integrity and secondary caries.
