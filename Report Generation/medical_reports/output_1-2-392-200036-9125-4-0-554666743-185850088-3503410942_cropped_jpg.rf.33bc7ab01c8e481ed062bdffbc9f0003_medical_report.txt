**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
- **Total visualized teeth**: 28 teeth (FDI numbering system).  
- **Wisdom teeth status**:  
  - #18 (mandibular left third molar) and #48 (maxillary left third molar) are fully erupted and unimpacted.  
- **Overall dental alignment**: No significant malpositioning or crowding observed.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Impacted tooth near #37 (mandibular right first molar)**: Clear indication of an impacted tooth adjacent to #37.  
2. **Caries suspicious in proximity to #46 (maxillary left first molar)**: Two suspicious carious lesions detected near #46.  
3. **Periapical radiolucency near #46**: Areas of concern noted for periapical radiolucency adjacent to #46, requiring further evaluation.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **Root canal-treated tooth #37**: Evidence of prior root canal therapy.  
2. **Restoration near #37**: A restoration is present adjacent to the root canal-treated tooth.  
3. **Root canal-treated tooth near #12 (maxillary right first premolar)**: A rc-treated tooth detected in proximity to #12.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted tooth near #37**: Requires clinical correlation to assess for potential impaction-related complications (e.g., periodontal issues, caries).  
2. **Caries suspicion near #46**: Confirmatory diagnosis and intervention necessary to prevent progression.  
3. **Periapical radiolucency near #46**: Indicates possible apical pathology; endodontic evaluation is warranted.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- **Oral hygiene reinforcement**: Emphasize biofilm control around #37 and #46 to mitigate caries risk.  
- **Calculus monitoring**: Although no calculus is explicitly noted, routine scaling is recommended to maintain periodontal health.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
1. **6-month recall**: To monitor the impacted tooth near #37 and carious lesions near #46.  
2. **Referral to endodontist**: For #46 to assess the periapical radiolucency and confirm the need for treatment.  
3. **Review of historical interventions**: Confirm the integrity of restorations near #37 and evaluate the long-term success of root canal therapy in #37 and #12.
