**Oral Panoramic X-Ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 29 teeth are visualized within the panoramic image. Wisdom teeth (#18 and #28) are present and non-impacted. The maxillary right third molar (#18) is fully erupted, while the mandibular right third molar (#28) is visible but with reduced clarity in localization.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Tooth #11 (mandibular right lateral incisor):** Suspicious for calculus deposits.  
- **Tooth #24 (maxillary left first premolar):** Suggests a root-stump, indicating prior extraction or resorption.  
- **Near tooth #37 (mandibular right first molar):** Clear indication of an impacted tooth structure in the posterior mandible.  
- **Near tooth #47 (maxillary right first molar):** Definitive evidence of an impacted tooth in the maxillary right posterior region.  
- **Near tooth #16 (mandibular right first molar):** Areas of concern for caries in the mesial aspect.  
- **Near tooth #15 (mandibular right second premolar):** Areas of concern for caries in the distal aspect.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorative treatments, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. Impacted tooth near #37 (mandibular right first molar) and #47 (maxillary right first molar) requiring radiographic and clinical evaluation.  
2. Root-stump in #24 (maxillary left first premolar) suggesting incomplete tooth removal or resorption.  
3. Suspected caries near #16 (#15) and #15 (#16) necessitating close monitoring for progression.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols to mitigate calculus accumulation on #11.  
- Monitor suspicious areas near #15/#16 for caries development.  
- Provide dietary counseling to reduce cariogenic risk factors.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Urgent referral to oral surgeon** for assessment of impacted teeth near #37 and #47.  
- **Clinical correlation** for the root-stump in #24 to determine if extraction or surgical intervention is required.  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic reassessment of caries near #15/#16 and calculus in #11.  
- Schedule **follow-up within 3 months** for impacted tooth evaluation and treatment planning.
