**ORAL PANORAMIC X-RAY EXAMINATION REPORT**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 23 teeth are visualized, with complete eruption of the posterior dentition. Wisdom teeth status: #28 is fully erupted and unimpacted; other wisdom teeth (#18, #38, #48) are not visualized in the field.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **#26**: Suspicious for caries with radiolucent demineralization noted in the mesial aspect.  
2. **#21**: Area of concern for supragingival calculus accumulation on the lingual surface.  
3. **Near tooth #16**: Suspicious for a root stump adjacent to the apical region, consistent with prior extraction remnants.  
4. **Near tooth #47**: Area of concern for impacted structure (likely a residual fragment or supernumerary tooth) adjacent to the apical third of #47.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **#16**: Presence of a composite restoration with well-defined margins and no evidence of secondary caries.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Deep suspicious caries on #26** requiring immediate endodontic evaluation to prevent pulpal involvement.  
2. **Impacted structure near #47** necessitating cone-beam CT imaging to assess its relationship with adjacent anatomic structures.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
1. Reinforce biofilm control measures for calculus-prone areas (#21).  
2. Monitor radiopaque root stump near #16 for signs of resorption or infection.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
1. Schedule endodontic referral for #26 within 2 weeks.  
2. Order CBCT imaging for impacted fragment near #47 to guide surgical planning.  
3. 6-month recall for radiographic and clinical monitoring of all suspicious findings.
