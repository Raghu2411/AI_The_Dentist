**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **1. General Condition**  
A total of 31 teeth are visualized, with all primary dentition structures accounted for except for a missing upper left third molar (#28). Wisdom teeth analysis reveals:  
- **Tooth #18 (lower left third molar)**: Fully erupted, non-impacted.  
- **Tooth #48 (lower right third molar)**: Impacted (horizontal orientation).  
- **Tooth #28 (upper right third molar)**: Fully erupted, non-impacted.  

Dentition demonstrates no significant attrition or malalignment.  

#### **2. Pathological Findings**  
- **Tooth #48**: Suspicious for impacted wisdom tooth (low confidence).  
- **Near tooth #37**: Clear indication of impacted structures, likely a horizontally positioned radiopaque mass compressing the distal aspect of #37.  

No evidence of caries, periapical radiolucency, or osseous pathology.  

#### **3. Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorative treatments (fillings, crowns, root canal therapy) or implants observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted lower right third molar (#48)**: Requires evaluation for surgical extraction due to high risk of pericoronitis and caries.  
2. **Impacted structures near #37**: Suspected horizontal impaction adjacent to lower right second molar, necessitating 3D imaging (CBCT) for precise localization.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce interdental cleaning techniques to minimize biofilm accumulation around impacted #48.  
- Monitor for early signs of infection (e.g., swelling, pain) in the #37 region.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to oral surgeon**: For surgical planning and extraction of #48.  
- **CBCT imaging**: To assess anatomical relationship of impacted structures near #37.  
- **6-month recall**: For clinical and radiographic monitoring of unresolved areas.
