**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

**General Condition**  
A total of 29 teeth are visualized within the field of view. All three identified wisdom teeth (#48, #38, #28) are present and unimpacted. No evidence of recent eruptive or positional pathology is observed in the mandibular or maxillary arches.  

**Pathological Findings**  
1. **#15**: Suspicious for periapical radiolucency noted at the apical region.  
2. **#12**: Suspicious for supragingival calculus on the buccal aspect.  
3. **#24**: Sign of root-stump with incomplete resorption in the apical third.  
4. **Near #35**: Sign of root-stump in the interdental space lingual to #35.  
5. **Near #48**: Sign of carious lesion in the mesial aspect of the distal root fragment.  
6. **Near #16**: Suspected carious lesion in the proximal contact area.  
7. **Near #24**: Areas of concern for multiple carious lesions in the mesial and distal interproximal surfaces.  
8. **Near #15**: Suspicious for small carious lesion in the apical aspect of the root fragment.  
9. **Near #45**: Areas of concern for carious lesions in the apical region.  

**Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorative, endodontic, or implant interventions are observed in the panoramic field.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
1. Root-stump in the apical region of **#24** may require surgical evaluation for complete removal.  
2. Carious lesions near **#48** and **#24** necessitate early intervention to prevent pulp involvement.  
3. Periapical radiolucency on **#15** warrants endodontic assessment due to potential apical pathology.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols to manage calculus accumulation on **#12**.  
- Monitor areas of suspected caries near **#16**, **#45**, and **#15** for progression.  
- Educate on dietary modifications and fluoride use to mitigate caries risk in high-risk zones.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule a **6-month recall** for radiographic reassessment of carious and periapical lesions.  
- Referral to an **endodontist** is recommended for definitive diagnosis of **#15** periapical radiolucency.  
- Surgical consultation for **#24** root-stump to evaluate resorption timeline and surgical candidacy.
