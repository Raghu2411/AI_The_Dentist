**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 28 teeth are visualized. All three wisdom teeth (#18, #38, #48) are present and unimpacted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **#16**: Suspicious for carious lesion with radiolucent appearance (score: 0.23).  
2. **#21**: Suspected calculus deposition in the apical third.  
3. **#12**: Suspected calculus noted near the cementoenamel junction.  
4. **Near #44**: Root stump identified adjacent to the apical region.  
5. **Near #38**: Suspected carious lesion in the cervical area (score: 0.75).  
6. **Near #44**: Areas of concern for periapical radiolucency (score: 0.49).  
7. **Near #15**: Suggestive radiolucency in the interproximal region (score: 0.19).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. Restoration present adjacent to #37.  
2. Root canal-treated tooth observed near #37.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- Root stump near #44 requiring evaluation for potential retention or removal.  
- Suspected carious lesions near #38 and #16 necessitating confirmation with supplemental imaging.  
- Periapical radiolucency near #44 to be assessed for apical pathology.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols to address areas of suspected calculus (#21, #12).  
- Monitor interproximal caries near #15 and #38 for progression.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule 6-month recall for re-evaluation of periapical radiolucency (#44).  
- Referral to endodontist for definitive diagnosis and management of #44 apical lesion.  
- Consider second-opinion consultation for root stump near #44.
