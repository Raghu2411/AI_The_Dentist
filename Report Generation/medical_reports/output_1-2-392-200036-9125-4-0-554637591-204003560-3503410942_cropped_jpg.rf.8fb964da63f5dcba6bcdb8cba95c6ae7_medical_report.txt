**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 27 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field. No wisdom teeth are present bilaterally, indicating complete absence of third molars. The remaining dentition demonstrates normal anatomical alignment and spatial distribution.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
No radiographic evidence of dental caries, periodontal disease, periapical radiolucencies, or other pathological lesions is observed. The alveolar bone height and density appear within normal limits across all regions.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No restorative materials (fillings, crowns), root canal-treated teeth, or dental implants are identified within the radiographic field.

### **2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- No urgent or significant pathological conditions are detected at this time.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce patient education on daily plaque control, including interdental brushing and flossing techniques.  
- Emphasize dietary counseling to minimize sugar intake and reduce caries risk.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule a 6-month recall for routine oral examination and hygiene maintenance.  
- Annual panoramic radiography is recommended for ongoing baseline monitoring of asymptomatic posterior regions and developmental changes.  
- Refer to a specialist if new symptoms arise (e.g., pain, swelling, or functional concerns).
