**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
No urgent dental issues are present.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce routine oral hygiene practices, including interdental cleaning and fluoride use.  
- Educate on dietary modifications to minimize caries risk.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule a 6-month recall for routine monitoring and panoramic re-evaluation.  
- Maintain annual bitewing radiographs to screen for interproximal caries.  
- Refer to an orthodontist for wisdom tooth (#38/#48) positional assessment if eruptive complications arise.
