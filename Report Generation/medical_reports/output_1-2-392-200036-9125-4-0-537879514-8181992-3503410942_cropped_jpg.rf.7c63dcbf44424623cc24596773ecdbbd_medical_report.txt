**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

**1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  
**General Condition**  
A total of 16 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field. Wisdom teeth #38 (right maxillary) and #28 (left mandibular) are present and unimpacted.  

**Pathological Findings**  
- **Root Stumps**:  
  - Clear indication of root stumps near teeth #27 (score 0.93), #47 (0.88), and #33 (0.82).  
  - Suspicious for root stumps near teeth #23 (0.80), #35 (0.78), and #35 (0.78).  
- **Caries**:  
  - Evidence of caries near teeth #23 (0.65) and #12 (0.28).  
  - Areas of concern noted for suspected caries near teeth #35 (0.41), #17 (0.33), #47 (0.27), and #13 (0.19).  
- **Periapical Radiolucency**:  
  - Suspicious for periapical radiolucency near tooth #33 (0.40).  
- **Additional Concerns**:  
  - Areas of carious involvement observed near tooth #23 (0.23) and #13 (0.19) require further clinical correlation.  

**Historical Interventions**  
- **Restorative Treatments**:  
  - Presence of a crown near tooth #12.  
  - Evidence of restorations near teeth #13 and #23.  
- **Endodontic Therapy**:  
  - Root canal-treated teeth identified near #12, #13, #17, and #23.  

**2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
**Priority Concerns**  
- Root stumps near teeth #27, #47, and #33 indicate prior extractions requiring documentation.  
- Root canal-treated teeth at #12, #13, #17, and #23 necessitate evaluation for long-term prognosis.  
- Suspicious carious lesions near teeth #23, #12, and #35 warrant clinical correlation to rule out active decay.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols to mitigate caries progression in high-risk areas (#23, #12).  
- Monitor suspected root stumps near teeth #23 and #35 for potential bony irregularities.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule 3-month recall for reassessment of carious lesions near #23 and #35.  
- Refer to endodontist for evaluation of periapical radiolucency near #33.  
- Consider radiographic correlation for low-confidence caries near #17 and #47.
