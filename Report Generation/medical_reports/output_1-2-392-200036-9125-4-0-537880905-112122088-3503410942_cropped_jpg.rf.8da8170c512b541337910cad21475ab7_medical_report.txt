**Oral Panoramic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 28 teeth were visualized within the panoramic field. All permanent teeth are present and anatomically identifiable. No wisdom teeth (third molars) were detected.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Tooth #12 (Upper Right Lateral Incisor):** Suspicious for periodontal calculus deposition, as subtle radiopaque accumulations are noted in the apical region.  
2. **Near Tooth #37 (Lower Left Second Molar):** Shows evidence of an impacted anatomical structure, likely a retained developmental cyst or bony impaction.  
3. **Near Tooth #47 (Lower Right Second Molar):** Clear indication of an impacted entity adjacent to the apical region, consistent with a radiolucent defect or cystic formation.  
4. **Near Tooth #27 (Upper Left Second Molar):** Radiographic evidence of a bony impaction along the distal root surface.  
5. **Near Tooth #17 (Upper Right Second Molar):** Impacted lesion identified near the apical region, suggestive of a resorptive or cystic process.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No restorations, root canal treatments, crowns, or implants were identified in the visualized field.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted structures near multiple molars:** Radiolucent or radiopaque lesions near teeth #37, #47, #27, and #17 require further diagnostic evaluation (e.g., CBCT imaging) to determine etiology and surgical intervention needs.  
2. **Calculus suspicion on #12:** Suspected subgingival calculus at #12 warrants scaling and root planing to mitigate periodontal risk.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce meticulous oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interdental cleaning for impacted regions.  
- Monitor areas of suspected calculus with follow-up radiographs in 3–6 months.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral:** Urgent consultation with an oral surgeon or endodontist for evaluation of impacted lesions near molars (#37, #47, #27, #17).  
- **Recall:** Schedule a 6-month follow-up to reassess calculus management and track changes in impacted regions.  
- **Patient Education:** Advise against self-manipulation of impacted areas and emphasize compliance with hygiene regimens.
