**Teeth-Specific Observations**  

1. **General Condition**  
   A total of 31 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field. All detected third molars (#38, #48, #28) are present and not impacted. No evidence of missing or supernumerary teeth is observed.  

2. **Pathological Findings**  
   - Suspicious for **calculus** on #12, noted as a radiopaque deposit on the root surface.  
   - **Caries** observed as a radiolucent lesion near tooth #16, with low confidence in localization (score < 0.80).  

3. **Historical Interventions**  
   No restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are identified.

**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
- **Suspicious calculus on #12** requires professional scaling and polishing.  
- **Area of concern near #16** (suspicious for caries) warrants further evaluation with intraoral imaging or clinical examination to confirm.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce patient education on plaque control and interdental cleaning techniques.  
- Monitor suspicious areas for progression during routine recall visits.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule a 6-month recall to reassess calculus on #12 and evaluate the lesion near #16.  
- If caries is confirmed, refer for restorative treatment.  
- Consider targeted imaging (e.g., periapical radiograph) for the #16 region to clarify the lesion’s extent.
