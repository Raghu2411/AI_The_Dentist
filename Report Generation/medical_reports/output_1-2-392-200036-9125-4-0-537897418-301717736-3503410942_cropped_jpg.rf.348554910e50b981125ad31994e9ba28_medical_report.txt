**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  
**1. General Condition**  
A total of 29 teeth were visualized using the FDI numbering system. All four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) were present and erupted without evidence of impaction.  

**2. Pathological Findings**  
- **Tooth #27**: Areas of concern noted for **periapical radiolucency** at the apical region.  
- **Tooth #26**: Suspicious for **caries** on the mesiobuccal surface.  
- **Near tooth #38**: Areas of concern noted for **caries** on the distal surface.  
- **Near tooth #37**: Suspicious for **caries** on the mesial surface.  
- **Near tooth #46**: Areas of concern noted for **periapical radiolucency** adjacent to the apical region.  

**3. Historical Interventions**  
- **Near tooth #46**: Presence of a **root canal-treated** tooth with radiolucent changes in the apical region.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
**Priority Concerns**  
- Suspicious **caries** near tooth #38 and #37 require clinical correlation and possible restorative intervention.  
- **Periapical radiolucency** near tooth #46 (associated with a root canal-treated tooth) warrants further evaluation for apical pathology.  
- **Tooth #27** and **#26** demonstrate areas of concern requiring close monitoring for progressive caries or endodontic involvement.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene measures, particularly around teeth #37, #38, and #46.  
- Monitor suspicious caries near #37, #38, and #26 for progression.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic and clinical reassessment of suspicious lesions.  
- Referral to an **endodontist** for evaluation of apical radiolucency near #46 and suspected caries on #26.  
- Consider **restorative intervention** for caries near #37 and #38 after definitive diagnosis.
