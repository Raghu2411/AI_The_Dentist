**ORAL PANORAMIC RADIOLUCENT EXAMINATION REPORT**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
- **Tooth Count**: 23 visible teeth identified within the standard dental arch.  
- **Wisdom Teeth**: One visible mandibular left third molar (#18) detected in non-impacted position. No other wisdom teeth visualized.  
- **Overall Integrity**: Majority of teeth demonstrate normal morphology and alignment.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Impacted Teeth**:  
  - Clear indication of impacted molar **near #37** (mandibular right).  
  - Clear indication of impacted molar **near #47** (maxillary left).  
  - Clear indication of impacted molar **near #27** (maxillary right).  
- **Caries Suspicions**:  
  - Suspicious for carious lesion **near #47** (maxillary left).  
  - Areas of concern noted for possible carious involvement **near #16** (mandibular right).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Root Canal Treatments (RCT)**:  
  - Rc-treated tooth noted **near #11** (mandibular left incisor).  
  - Rc-treated tooth noted **near #16** (mandibular right first molar).  
  - Rc-treated tooth noted **near #25** (maxillary right second premolar).  
  - Rc-treated tooth noted **near #34** (mandibular left first molar).  
- **Restorative Procedures**:  
  - Restoration present **near #34** (mandibular left first molar).  
  - Crown placement documented **near #34** (mandibular left first molar).

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted Molars**: Immediate evaluation required for impacted molars near #37, #47, and #27 due to risk of periodontal inflammation and adjacent tooth resorption.  
2. **Caries Suspicions**: Close monitoring of suspicious carious lesions near #47 and #16; consider confirmatory diagnostics and early intervention.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene education for interproximal areas near impacted molars to mitigate periodontal risks.  
- Advise dietary modifications to reduce cariogenic exposure in high-risk regions (#47, #16).  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral**: Urgent referral to oral surgeon for surgical assessment of impacted molars (#37, #47, #27).  
- **Recall Schedule**: 6-month radiographic follow-up to monitor carious lesions (#47, #16) and impacted tooth progression.  
- **Endodontic Review**: Annual evaluation of rc-treated teeth (#11, #16, #25, #34) for apical health and restoration integrity.
