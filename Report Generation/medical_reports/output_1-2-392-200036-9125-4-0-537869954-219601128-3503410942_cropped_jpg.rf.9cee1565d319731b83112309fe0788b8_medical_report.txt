**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 25 teeth were visualized, with no evidence of erupting wisdom teeth. All permanent teeth in the field of view appear to be in functional occlusion.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Impacted Teeth**:  
   - Clear indication of an impacted tooth near **#37** (right maxillary first molar) and **#46** (left mandibular first molar).  
   - Suspicious for impacted tooth near **#17** (left mandibular second molar) with low confidence.  

2. **Caries**:  
   - Suspicious for carious lesions near **#37**, **#26** (right mandibular first molar), and **#36** (right maxillary first molar).  
   - Areas of concern noted for potential caries near **#46**, **#16** (left mandibular first molar), **#13** (left maxillary lateral incisor), **#25** (right mandibular second premolar), and **#24** (right mandibular first molar).  

3. **Periapical Radiolucency**:  
   - Area of concern noted near **#16** (left mandibular first molar), requiring further evaluation.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **Restorations**:  
   - Presence of a restoration near **#46** (left mandibular first molar).  
2. **Root Canal Treatments (RCT)**:  
   - RCT-treated tooth near **#16** (left mandibular first molar) and **#46** (left mandibular first molar).  
   - RCT-treated tooth near **#13** (left maxillary lateral incisor).  
3. **Crowns**:  
   - Crowns identified near **#16** (left mandibular first molar) and **#13** (left maxillary lateral incisor).

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted Teeth**:  
   - Impacted tooth near **#37** and **#46** requires evaluation for surgical removal or orthodontic intervention.  
2. **High-Risk Caries**:  
   - Suspected carious lesions near **#37** and **#26** warrant immediate assessment for intervention.  
3. **Periapical Radiolucency**:  
   - Radiolucency near **#16** should be evaluated for apical pathology or residual infection post-RCT.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene instruction, emphasizing interproximal cleaning for high-risk areas (#37, #26).  
- Monitor suspicious caries near **#46**, **#13**, and **#25** for progression.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic and clinical reassessment of caries and impacted teeth.  
- **Referral to endodontist** for evaluation of periapical radiolucency near **#16**.  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for impacted teeth near **#37** and **#46** to assess surgical feasibility.
