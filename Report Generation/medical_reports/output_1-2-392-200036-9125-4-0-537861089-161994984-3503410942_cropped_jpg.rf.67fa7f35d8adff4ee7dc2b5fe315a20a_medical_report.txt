   - Periapatial radiolucency and suspected caries near #25 necessitating further diagnostic assessment.  
   - Calculus deposits on #22 and near #13.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Reinforce plaque control and calculus removal for #22 and near #13.  
   - Emphasize caries prevention strategies for areas near #25.  
   - Schedule regular hygiene appointments to manage calculus risk.  

3. **Follow-up Protocol**  
   - **Referral to oral surgeon** for evaluation of impacted teeth near #47 and #37.  
   - **Referral to endodontist** for further assessment of periapical radiolucency on #25.  
   - **6-month recall** to monitor suspicious caries near #25 and calculus deposits.  
   - **Dental hygiene recall in 3 months** to address localized calculus and plaque accumulation.
