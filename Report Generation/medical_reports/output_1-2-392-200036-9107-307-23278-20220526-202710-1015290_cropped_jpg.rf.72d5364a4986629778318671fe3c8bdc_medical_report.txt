**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**

#### **1. General Condition**  
A total of 24 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field. Both upper left (FDI #18) and lower right (FDI #38) wisdom teeth are present and unimpacted. The remaining dentition demonstrates normal anatomy with no evidence of fractures or luxation.  

---

#### **2. Pathological Findings**  
- **Sign of caries** near **#18** (upper left wisdom tooth).  
- **Suspicious for caries** near **#27** (lower right second molar); additional findings near **#17** (#17) and **#47** (#47) are noted but require confirmation due to low confidence.  
- **Suspicious for root stump** near **#27**; radiographic lucency suggests prior extraction or resorption.  
- **Areas of concern for caries** near **#14** (upper left first molar) and **#38** (lower right wisdom tooth).  

---

#### **3. Historical Interventions**  
- **Root canal-treated** teeth identified near **#35** (lower right second premolar), **#38** (lower right wisdom tooth), **#43** (upper left first molar), and **#47** (upper left third molar).  
- **Crowns** present on **#35** (lower right second premolar), **#38** (lower right wisdom tooth), and **#43** (upper left first molar).

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Caries near #18** (upper left wisdom tooth) and **#27** (lower right second molar) require immediate evaluation for restoration or extraction.  
2. **Root stump near #27** may necessitate surgical removal to prevent infection or bony resorption.  
3. **Unconfirmed caries near #17**, **#47**, **#14**, and **#38** warrant clinical correlation with tactile examination.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce biofilm control near #18 and #27 with interdental brushing.  
- Monitor suspicious caries near #17, #47, #14, and #38 during recalls.  
- Advise dietary counseling to reduce cariogenic risk.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic reassessment of carious lesions.  
- **Referral to endodontist** for evaluation of #38 root canal-treated tooth.  
- **Dental surgery consultation** for root stump (#27) and impacted wisdom teeth if mobility or symptoms develop.
