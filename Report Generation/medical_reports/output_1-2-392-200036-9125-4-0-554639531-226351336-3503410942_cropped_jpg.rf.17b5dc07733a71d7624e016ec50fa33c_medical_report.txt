**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 30 teeth are visualized, with full eruption of permanent dentition confirmed. Wisdom teeth (#18 and #28) are present and unimpacted. No evidence of supernumerary or missing teeth is observed.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **#15 (Left Mandibular Second Premolar):** Suspicious for periapical radiolucency at the apical region, suggesting possible apical periodontitis requiring further evaluation.  
2. **Near #37 (Right Maxillary Second Molar):** Clear indication of impacted anatomical structure in proximity, consistent with unerupted third molar or developmental anomaly.  
3. **Near #47 (Left Maxillary Third Molar):** Suspicious for impacted structure adjacent to the left maxillary third molar, warranting closer clinical assessment.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorative treatments (fillings, crowns, root canal therapy) or implants are detected.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. Deep suspicion of apical pathology in #15, necessitating endodontic evaluation.  
2. Impacted structure near #37 requires radiographic correlation and surgical planning.  
3. Area near #47 shows potential for impacted tooth development, requiring monitoring.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols to mitigate periodontal risk in peri-radicular regions.  
- Counsel patient on dietary modifications to reduce caries risk in susceptible premolars.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic re-evaluation of #15 and impacted regions.  
- **Referral to endodontist** for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning for #15.  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for surgical exposure or removal of impacted structures near #37 and #47 if symptomatic.
