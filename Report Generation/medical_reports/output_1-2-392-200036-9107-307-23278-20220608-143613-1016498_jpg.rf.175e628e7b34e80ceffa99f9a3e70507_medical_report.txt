**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
A total of 29 teeth were visualized on the panoramic radiograph. All four wisdom teeth (#18, #48, #28, #38) are present and unimpacted. The dental arches demonstrate normal alignment with no apparent fractures or malpositions.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Suspected calculus deposition** noted on #23, #12, and #21.  
- **Areas of concern for periapical radiolucency** identified near #15 (FDI 15).  
- **Suspicious for carious lesion** on #26 (FDI 26), consistent with early enamel demineralization.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorative or endodontic treatments observed.  

---

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Deep caries on #26** requires immediate intervention to prevent pulp involvement.  
2. **Periapical radiolucency near #15** necessitates further evaluation (e.g., CBCT) to rule out apical periodontitis.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce biofilm control protocols to mitigate calculus progression on #12, #21, and #23.  
- Educate on diet modification to reduce caries risk, particularly for #26.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule **6-month recall** for reassessment of calculus and radiographic changes.  
- **Referral to endodontist** for #15 to determine apical pathology.  
- **Dental operative treatment** (restoration) prioritized for #26 within 2 weeks.
