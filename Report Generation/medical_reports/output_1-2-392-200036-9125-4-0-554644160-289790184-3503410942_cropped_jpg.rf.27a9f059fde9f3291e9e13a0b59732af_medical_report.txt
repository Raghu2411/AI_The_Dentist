**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

**1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  

**General Condition**  
The panoramic radiograph visualizes **26 teeth** in the FDI numbering system. All four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) are present and **not impacted**. The dentition shows a mix of natural teeth and dental implants.  

**Pathological Findings**  
- **Caries**:  
  - #13 (right central incisor) exhibits suspicious lucency in the enamel-dentin junction, consistent with **suspicious for occlusal caries**.  
  - **Areas of concern noted for caries** near #15 (left first molar), potentially involving the proximal surface.  
- **Periapical Radiolucency**:  
  - **Suspicious for periapical radiolucency** at the apical region of #15 (left first molar), suggesting possible apical periodontitis.  
- **Calculus**:  
  - **Suspected supragingival calculus** detected on the lingual surfaces of #12 (right lateral incisor) and #21 (left central incisor).  

**Historical Interventions**  
- **Restoration**: Presence of a composite resin restoration on the mesial surface of #15.  
- **Root Canal-Treated (RC-Treated)**: Radiographic evidence of a root canal-treated #15 with a post space.  
- **Crown**: A metal-ceramic crown is apparent on #15.  
- **Implants**:  
  - Implant near #38 (right third molar), #25 (left first premolar), #27 (left second molar), #48 (left third molar), and #45 (right first molar).  
  - All implants demonstrate osseointegration and no signs of peri-implant radiolucency.

**2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
1. **Suspicious periapical radiolucency on #15** requiring further evaluation for potential apical pathology.  
2. **Caries involvement on #13** and **near #15** necessitating prompt intervention to prevent progression.  
3. **Suspected calculus deposits on #12 and #21** indicating a need for professional scaling and hygiene reinforcement.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene practices, emphasizing interdental cleaning (flossing or interdental brushes) for caries-prone areas.  
- Educate on biofilm control to minimize calculus accumulation on anterior teeth.  
- Advise fluoride supplementation for caries-prone regions (#13 and #15).  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Urgent**: Referral to endodontist for evaluation of #15’s periapical radiolucency.  
- **Dental Hygiene Recall**: Schedule scaling and root planing within 4 weeks, focusing on #12 and #21.  
- **Recall Interval**: 6-month follow-up to monitor caries near #15 and implant health.
