**Oral Panoramic X-Ray Examination Report**  

---

### **1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
- A total of **25 teeth** are visualized.  
- **Wisdom teeth status**: Tooth #18 (FDI 18) is **erupted and unimpacted**; no additional wisdom teeth are identified.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Tooth #18**: Suspicious for **caries** (low confidence).  
- **Near tooth #37**: Clear indication of **root stump**.  
- **Near tooth #18**: Suspected **root stump** (confidence < 0.80).  
- **Near tooth #27**: Suspicious for **root stump** and **caries** (confidence < 0.80).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- No prior restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are observed.

### **2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Deep caries on #18**: Requires urgent evaluation for potential restorative intervention.  
2. **Root stumps near #37 and #27**: Indicates prior extraction; assess for residual fragments or infection.  
3. **Suspected root stump near #18**: Monitor for signs of pathology or bone resorption.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce **oral hygiene protocols** to mitigate caries progression in #18.  
- Emphasize **regular radiographic monitoring** for root stumps to detect early complications (e.g., infection or resorption).  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to endodontist** for definitive diagnosis and treatment of suspected caries on #18 and root stumps near #37/#27.  
- **6-month recall** for clinical and radiographic reassessment of root stumps.  
- **Dental hygiene appointment** to address calculus risk (suspected in areas adjacent to root stumps).
