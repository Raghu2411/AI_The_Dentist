**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 31 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field. All detected wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38) are present and unimpacted. No significant anatomical abnormalities or malpositions are observed.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Tooth #26**: Suspicious for periapical radiolucency, suggesting potential apical pathology.  
2. **Near tooth #47**: Areas of concern noted for suspected impacted structures.  
3. **Near tooth #47**: Areas of concern noted for suspicious carious lesions.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. Restoration noted near tooth #27.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Tooth #26**: Periapical radiolucency requires clinical correlation to rule out endodontic pathology.  
2. **Near tooth #47**: Combined suspicious findings of impacted structures and caries necessitate further evaluation.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
1. Reinforce oral hygiene practices with a focus on the #47 region to mitigate caries progression.  
2. Monitor areas of suspected calculus (not explicitly detailed in findings but implied by restorative interventions).  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
1. **Referral to endodontist**: Urgent evaluation for tooth #26 to confirm periapical pathology.  
2. **Dental imaging follow-up**: Cone-beam CT or high-resolution imaging for #47 to clarify impacted structures and carious involvement.  
3. **6-month recall**: Monitor restorative integrity near #27 and progression of suspicious lesions.
