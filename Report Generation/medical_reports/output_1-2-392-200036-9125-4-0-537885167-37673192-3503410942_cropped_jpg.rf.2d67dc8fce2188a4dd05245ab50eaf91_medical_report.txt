**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 26 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field. All four wisdom teeth (*#48 and #38*) are present and non-impacted. The remaining dentition appears fully erupted, with no evidence of gross anatomical displacement or congenital absence.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
No active pathological conditions, including caries, periapical radiolucencies, or retained roots, are identified. No signs of periodontal pathology or impacted teeth are observed.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **Crown**: Present on #44.  
2. **Restoration**: Detected near tooth #23 and #34.  
3. **Root canal-treated (RC-treated)**: Evidence of RC treatment near tooth #37 and #44.  
4. **Crown**: Additional crowns noted near tooth #47 and #44.  
5. **Restoration**: Minor restoration near tooth #14.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- No urgent pathological conditions identified.  
- Historical interventions (crowns, restorations) are noted but do not require immediate intervention.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene practices to maintain periodontal health.  
- Continue regular monitoring of restored teeth (#23, #34, #14) and RC-treated areas (#37, #44) for secondary caries or structural compromise.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for routine evaluation of periodontal and restorative status.  
- Annual panoramic imaging recommended to assess stability of historical interventions and detect early signs of pathology.  
- Patient counseling on dietary habits and home care to preserve existing restorations and prevent future caries.
