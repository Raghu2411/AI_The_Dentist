**ORAL PANORAMIC X-RAY EXAMINATION REPORT**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
A total of 27 teeth are visualized, including both upper and lower wisdom teeth (#38 and #48). The wisdom teeth are fully erupted and not impacted. No evidence of missing or supernumerary teeth is noted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Caries**: Areas of concern are noted suspicious for caries near tooth #25 (left second molar).  
- **Periapical Radiolucency**: A suspicious radiolucent area is observed near tooth #46 (left first molar), potentially indicating periapical pathology.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are observed in the examined teeth.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Caries Risk**: The suspicious caries near #25 requires immediate evaluation to confirm presence and extent.  
2. **Periapical Radiolucency**: The radiolucent lesion near #46 warrants investigation for possible apical periodontitis or other periapical pathology.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene practices, emphasizing interdental cleaning for #25 and #46.  
- Monitor caries-susceptible areas during routine check-ups.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule a 6-month recall for reassessment of findings.  
- Refer to an endodontist for advanced imaging (e.g., CBCT) and treatment planning for the periapical radiolucency near #46.  
- Recommend a dental cleaning session to address potential biofilm accumulation in posterior regions.
