**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---  

### **1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
- A total of **23 teeth** are visualized, with no detectable wisdom teeth present.  
- Visualized teeth include: #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #17, #21, #23, #24, #25, #26, #27, #33, #34, #35, #36, #37, #42, #43, #45, #46, #47.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Root stump noted near tooth #23**, indicating prior extraction or resorption.  
- **Suspected carious lesion near tooth #17**, with limited radiographic clarity suggesting early decay or developmental anomaly.  
- **Suspected carious involvement near tooth #15**, areas of concern noted for potential demineralization.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- No restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants identified in the visualized field.

### **2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **Root stump near #23** requires evaluation for complete removal or monitoring for infection.  
- **Suspected caries near #17 and #15** warrant early intervention to prevent progression.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols for interproximal areas of #17 and #15.  
- Monitor radiographic areas of concern during routine check-ups for changes in density.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule **6-month recall** for reassessment of suspected caries and root stump.  
- Refer to general dentist for **detailed evaluation of #17 and #15** to confirm caries and plan restorative care.  
- Consider surgical consultation for **residual root fragment near #23** if clinically symptomatic.
