**ORAL PANORAMIC X-RAY EXAMINATION REPORT**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of **23 teeth** are visualized. Wisdom tooth #18 (left lower third molar) is fully erupted and non-impacted. Remaining wisdom teeth are not directly visualized. No signs of gross anatomical displacement or supernumerary teeth.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Signs of impaction near tooth #37** (right upper first molar), suggesting a retained or impacted tooth in the adjacent region.  
2. **Signs of impaction near tooth #47** (left upper first molar).  
3. **Suspicious for impaction near tooth #27** (right lower first molar), requiring radiographic correlation.  
4. **Suspicious for caries near tooth #47** (left upper first molar), with limited radiographic opacity.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **Root canal-treated teeth**:  
   - Adjacent to tooth #34 (right lower first molar).  
   - Adjacent to tooth #23 (left upper lateral incisor).  
   - Adjacent to tooth #11 (right upper lateral incisor).  
   - Adjacent to tooth #16 (left upper first molar).  
2. **Restoration adjacent to tooth #34** (right lower first molar).

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted tooth near #37** and **#47** requiring radiographic evaluation for surgical planning.  
2. **Suspected caries near #47** necessitating clinical correlation and possible caries management.  
3. **Suspected impaction near #27** to be assessed for orthodontic or surgical intervention.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols for caries-prone regions (e.g., near #47).  
- Monitor for calculus accumulation in interproximal areas of multi-rooted teeth (e.g., near #34, #16).  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule **3–6 month recall** for radiographic reassessment of impacted regions (#37, #47, #27).  
- Refer to **endodontist** for evaluation of root canal-treated teeth (#23, #11, #16, #34) if periapical symptoms arise.  
- Perform **high-resolution imaging** (e.g., CBCT) for detailed assessment of impacted and suspicious carious lesions.
