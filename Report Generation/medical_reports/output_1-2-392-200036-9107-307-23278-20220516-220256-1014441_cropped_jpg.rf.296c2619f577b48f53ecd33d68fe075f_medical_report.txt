**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
- **Visualized Teeth**: 22 teeth identified using FDI numbering system (e.g., #11, #14, #16, #17, #21, #22, #24–#27, #31–#35, #41–#45).  
- **Wisdom Teeth**: No visible wisdom teeth detected bilaterally.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **#24 (right first molar)**: Suspicious for carious lesion in the occlusal surface.  
- **#16 (left first molar)**: Areas of concern noted for potential caries in the mesial aspect.  
- **#25 (right second molar)**: Suspected carious involvement in the distal region.  
- **Near tooth #14 (left first premolar)**: Lesion consistent with carious activity in adjacent interproximal area.  
- **Near tooth #26 (right first molar)**: Small radiolucent focus suspicious for early carious involvement.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Near tooth #14 (left first premolar)**: Evidence of previous root canal treatment.  
- **Near tooth #16 (left first molar)**: Presence of a crown restoration.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Deep carious lesions**: Suspected on #24, #16, and #25; requires immediate evaluation for restorative intervention.  
2. **Proximal caries near #14**: Adjacent lesion in interproximal region of root canal-treated tooth necessitates radiographic correlation and treatment planning.  
3. **Early carious focus near #26**: Small radiolucency adjacent to restored crown demands close monitoring for progression.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce biofilm control strategies, emphasizing interdental cleaning for high-risk areas (#14, #16, #24–#26).  
- Advise dietary counseling to minimize cariogenic exposure in posterior segments.  
- Apply fluoride varnish to susceptible surfaces (#14, #24, #25).  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for serial comparison of carious lesions in #14, #24–#25.  
- **Referral to endodontist** for comprehensive assessment of root canal-treated #14 and adjacent caries.  
- **Restorative planning** within 2 weeks for #24, #25, and monitoring of #16 crown integrity.
