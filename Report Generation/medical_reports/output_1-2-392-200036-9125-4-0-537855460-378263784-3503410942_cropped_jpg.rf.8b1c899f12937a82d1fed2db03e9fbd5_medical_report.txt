**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
**Priority Concerns**  
1. Impacted tooth near #47 requires evaluation for potential surgical removal.  
2. Suspicious calculus on #12 warrants periodontal assessment.  
3. Areas of suspected caries near #36, #37, and #27 necessitate confirmation via supplemental imaging or clinical correlation.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols to mitigate calculus accumulation.  
- Monitor impacted regions near #27 and #37 for signs of infection or resorption.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- 6-month recall for reassessment of calculus and impacted teeth.  
- Referral to a periodontist for calculus management on #12.  
- Referral to an endodontist for evaluation of carious lesions near #36 and #37.  
- Consider panoramic review in 3 months to monitor suspicious caries near #27 and #46.
