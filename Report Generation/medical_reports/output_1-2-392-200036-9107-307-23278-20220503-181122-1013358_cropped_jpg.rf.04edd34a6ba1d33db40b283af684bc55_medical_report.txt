**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
- **Total teeth visualized**: 30 teeth identified across the dental arch, with full dentition apparent.  
- **Wisdom teeth status**:  
  - #18 (left mandibular third molar) and #38 (right maxillary third molar) are present and unimpacted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Periapical radiolucency**: An area of concern noted at the apical region of #25 (right mandibular first molar).  
- **Suspected caries**:  
  - Suspicious for carious lesion near #15 (left mandibular lateral incisor).  
  - Area of concern for caries near #16 (left mandibular canine).  
  - Suspected carious involvement near #26 (right maxillary first molar).  
  - Areas of concern for caries near #37 (left mandibular first molar) and #38 (right maxillary third molar).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Restorations**:  
  - Presence of a restoration adjacent to #37 (left mandibular first molar).  
  - Restoration detected near #47 (left maxillary second molar).

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Periapical radiolucency at #25** requires endodontic evaluation to rule out apical periodontitis or abscess.  
2. **Suspected caries near #15, #16, #26, #37, and #38** demand immediate clinical correlation and preventive intervention.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interproximal cleaning for at-risk areas.  
- Monitor suspicious regions for caries progression during routine follow-ups.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic reassessment of periapical lesion at #25 and carious lesions.  
- **Referral to endodontist** for #25 if clinical symptoms (e.g., pain, swelling) emerge.  
- **Dental caries management** for high-risk sites via fluoride application or sealants as clinically indicated.
