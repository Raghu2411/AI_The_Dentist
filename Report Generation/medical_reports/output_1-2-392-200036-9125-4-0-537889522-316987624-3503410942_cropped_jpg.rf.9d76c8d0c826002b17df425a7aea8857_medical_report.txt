**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 21 teeth are visualized within the field of view. Wisdom teeth (FDI #48 and #38) are present and non-impacted. No evidence of supernumerary or missing teeth is noted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **#24 (upper left first molar):** Suspicious for caries in the mesial surface (low confidence due to overlapping anatomical structures).  
- **Near #11 (upper left lateral incisor):** A suspicious radiolucency consistent with residual root stump (score < 0.80).  
- **Near #15 (upper left first molar):** Two distinct root stumps identified (one with 0.88 confidence, one with 0.85 confidence).  
- **Near #26 (upper right second molar):** A root stump is observed (0.85 confidence).  
- **Near #24 (upper left first molar):** Additional root stumps and suspicious caries detected (0.79 and 0.64 confidence, respectively).  
- **Near #21 (upper right lateral incisor):** A suspicious radiolucency consistent with early caries (0.25 confidence).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are evident in the radiographic field.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Deep caries suspicious on #24 (upper left first molar).**  
2. **Multiple residual root stumps near #15, #24, and #26, indicating prior extractions.**  
3. **Early caries suspicious on #21 (upper right lateral incisor) requiring close monitoring.**  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interproximal cleaning for caries-prone areas.  
- Monitor residual root stumps for signs of infection or resorption.  
- Advise patient to maintain fluoride exposure and regular dental hygiene visits.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **3-month recall** for reassessment of suspicious caries on #24 and #21.  
- **6-month recall** to evaluate stability of residual root stumps and confirm absence of periapical pathology.  
- Referral to endodontic specialist if caries progress or root stumps demonstrate resorptive changes.
