**ORAL PANORAMIC X-RAY EXAMINATION REPORT**  

---

### **1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
The panoramic radiograph visualizes **32 teeth**, with all four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) present and non-impacted. The overall dental structure is well-defined, with no evidence of significant bone loss or resorption.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Suspicious for carious lesions near #15**: A small radiolucent area is noted adjacent to the mesial aspect of #15.  
- **Suggestive of early caries near #14**: A subtle radiolucency is observed adjacent to the distal surface of #14.  
- **Unusual radiolucency near #16**: An area of concern is identified near the buccal aspect of #16, potentially indicative of demineralization or early caries.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No restorations, root canal treatments, crowns, or implants are detected.

### **2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **Suspected carious lesions near upper posterior teeth**: The suspicious radiolucencies near #14, #15, and #16 require immediate clinical correlation to confirm caries or other pathologies.  
- **Wisdom teeth status**: All four third molars are erupted and non-impacted; however, their proximity to the lesions near #16 should be monitored for potential secondary caries.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- **Oral hygiene reinforcement**: Emphasize interdental cleaning (e.g., flossing, interproximal brushes) for the upper posterior region.  
- **Dietary counseling**: Limit fermentable carbohydrate intake to reduce cariogenic risk around the suspicious areas.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall**: Schedule a follow-up to reassess the suspicious lesions using high-resolution imaging (e.g., intraoral radiographs) for definitive diagnosis.  
- **Referral for intervention**: If caries progression is confirmed, refer for restorative therapy or endodontic evaluation as indicated.  
- **Wisdom tooth monitoring**: Continue periodic review of #18 and #28 for signs of periodontal or carious involvement.
