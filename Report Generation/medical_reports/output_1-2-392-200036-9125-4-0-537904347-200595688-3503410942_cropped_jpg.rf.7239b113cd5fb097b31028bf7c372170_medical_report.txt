**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

**1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  

**General Condition**  
A total of 28 teeth are visualized with clear anatomical localization. All four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) are present and non-impacted, demonstrating normal eruption patterns.  

**Pathological Findings**  
- Areas of concern noted for **suspicious carious lesions**:  
  - Near tooth #38 (right mandibular third molar), with radiolucent demarcation.  
  - Near tooth #14 (left maxillary second premolar), exhibiting low-confidence suspicious radiolucency.  

**Historical Interventions**  
- **Restorations**:  
  - Presence of a restoration near tooth #45 (left mandibular first molar).  
- **Root canal-treated teeth**:  
  - Rc-treated tooth noted near #47 (left mandibular third molar).  
  - Rc-treated teeth observed near #36 (right mandibular first molar) and #14 (left maxillary second premolar).  
- **Crowns**:  
  - Crowns identified near #36 (right mandibular first molar) and #14 (left maxillary second premolar).  

**2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
- **Suspicious carious lesions** near #38 and #14 require immediate clinical correlation for definitive diagnosis and intervention.  
- **Non-impacted wisdom teeth** (#18, #28, #38, #48) demonstrate normal alignment; no acute complications observed.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interproximal cleaning for high-risk areas (#38, #14).  
- Monitor suspicious radiolucent regions for progression during subsequent radiographic evaluations.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic reassessment of carious lesions and restorative integrity.  
- Referral to general dentist for clinical evaluation of suspicious caries near #38 and #14.  
- Continue regular surveillance of rc-treated teeth (#36, #14, #47) for apical health and restoration longevity.
