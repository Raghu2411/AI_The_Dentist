**Teeth-Specific Observations**  

**1. General Condition**  
A total of 28 teeth are visualized using FDI numbering. All permanent teeth are present, including the mandibular left first molar (#18), which is unimpacted and fully erupted. No evidence of missing or supernumerary teeth is noted. The dentition demonstrates adequate alignment and normal eruptive patterns.  

**2. Pathological Findings**  
- #15: Suspicious for periapical radiolucency (score: 0.29).  
- #22: Areas of concern noted for calculus (score: 0.4).  
- #25: Suspicious for caries (score: 0.27).  
- Near #26: Suspicious for caries (score: 0.58).  
- Near #15: Suggests caries involvement (score: 0.43).  

**3. Historical Interventions**  
- #25: Rc-treated tooth with coronal restoration (score: 0.73).  
- Near #26: Rc-treated tooth with crown placement (score: 0.9).  
- Near #26: Presence of a crown (score: 0.81).  
- Near #25: Presence of a crown (score: 0.75).  
- Near #17: Restoration with composite or amalgam (score: 0.69).

**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
1. Deep caries suspicious on #25 and near #26 require urgent evaluation for restorative intervention.  
2. Periapical radiolucency adjacent to #15 indicates potential endodontic pathology; further diagnostic assessment (e.g., CBCT) is warranted.  
3. Calculus deposits on #22 necessitate professional scaling and polishing.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce plaque control through biofilm disruption techniques (e.g., interdental brushes, antimicrobial rinses).  
- Monitor suspicious caries near #15 and #26 for progression during 3-month recall visits.  
- Educate on dietary modifications to reduce cariogenic exposure.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule 6-month recall for radiographic and clinical reassessment of caries lesions.  
- Refer to endodontist for evaluation of #15 periapical radiolucency.  
- Address calculus on #22 with prophylaxis and re-evaluate at 3-month interval.  
- Consider restorative planning for #25 and #26 within 2 weeks to prevent secondary caries or fracture.
