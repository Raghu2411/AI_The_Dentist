### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

**General Condition**  
A total of 32 teeth are visualized, with all four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, and #48) present and unimpacted. The dentition demonstrates adequate alignment and spatial distribution. No evidence of recent dental trauma or fractures is noted.  

**Pathological Findings**  
- Areas of concern noted for **calculus** on teeth #13 and #21.  
- **Suspicious for calculus** near tooth #12.  
- **Suspicious for carious lesion** on tooth #28.  

**Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are observed in the current examination.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
1. **Suspicious caries** on tooth #28 (upper right third molar) warrants immediate clinical evaluation to confirm diagnosis and prevent progression.  
2. **Areas of suspected calculus** on teeth #13, #21, and near tooth #12 require professional debridement and monitoring.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce patient education on plaque control techniques and interdental cleaning for calculus-prone regions.  
- Emphasize fluoride use and dietary counseling to mitigate caries risk in #28.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule **3-month recall** for reassessment of calculus deposits and caries confirmation via re-examination and, if necessary, supplemental imaging.  
- Proceed with **professional scaling** for calculus removal in the identified areas.  
- Refer for **endodontic consultation** if caries on #28 progresses to pulp involvement.
