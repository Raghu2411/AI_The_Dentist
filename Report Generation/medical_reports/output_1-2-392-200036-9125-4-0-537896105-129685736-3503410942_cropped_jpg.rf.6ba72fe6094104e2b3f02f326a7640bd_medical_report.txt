**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
A total of 30 teeth are visualized. All wisdom teeth are present, with #48 (lower left third molar) identified as impacted. The remaining wisdom teeth (#18, #38) are non-impacted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- Suspicious for heavy calculus deposits on #11 and #13.  
- Suspected periapical radiolucency at the apical region of #25.  
- Areas of concern for carious lesions near #46 (suspicious for proximal caries) and near #16 (suspicious for proximal caries).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No evidence of prior dental treatments (restorations, crowns, root canal therapy, or implants) is observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. Impacted lower left third molar (#48) requiring clinical evaluation for potential surgical removal.  
2. Suspicious carious lesions near #46 and #16; definitive diagnosis and intervention required.  
3. Periapical radiolucency at #25 (may indicate apical pathology).  
4. Calculus deposits on #11 and #13 (suggests need for professional scaling).  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interproximal cleaning techniques.  
- Monitor carious lesions near #46 and #16 during routine recall visits.  
- Address suspected calculus deposits to prevent periodontal complications.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral:** Consider surgical consultation for impacted #48. Evaluate #25 with endodontic imaging for apical lesion characterization.  
- **Recall:** Schedule 6-month follow-up for monitoring carious lesions and radiolucency.  
- **Immediate Care:** Professional scaling for #11 and #13 to remove calculus.
