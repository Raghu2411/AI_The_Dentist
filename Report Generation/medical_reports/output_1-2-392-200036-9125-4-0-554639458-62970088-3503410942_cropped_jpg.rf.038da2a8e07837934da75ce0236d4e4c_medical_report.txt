**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
The panoramic radiograph visualizes a total of 31 teeth, with all visible teeth present and no evidence of missing teeth. All four wisdom teeth (FDI #18, #28, #38, #48) are fully erupted and not impacted, as confirmed by their clear spatial relationships and absence of bony obstruction.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
No pathological conditions, including caries, periapical radiolucencies, or periodontal bone loss, are detected across the dentition. The absence of radiographic abnormalities indicates no active disease processes requiring immediate intervention.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
There is no radiographic evidence of prior restorative treatments (e.g., fillings, crowns, root canal therapy) or dental implants. The dentition appears untreated and retains natural tooth structure.

### **2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
No urgent or significant pathological concerns are identified. The dentition is within normal radiographic limits.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- **Oral hygiene reinforcement**: Emphasize daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste and interdental cleaning to prevent future cariogenic and periodontal risks.  
- **Dietary counseling**: Limit sugar intake to reduce caries susceptibility, particularly in high-risk areas (e.g., occlusal surfaces of molars).  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Routine recall**: Schedule a 6-month recall for panoramic re-evaluation and clinical examination to monitor dental health.  
- **Wisdom tooth monitoring**: While currently unimpacted, asymptomatic wisdom teeth (FDI #18, #28, #38, #48) should be periodically assessed for positional changes or functional concerns.
