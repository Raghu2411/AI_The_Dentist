**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
- **Tooth Count**: 24 teeth visualized, including both maxillary and mandibular arches.  
- **Wisdom Teeth**:  
  - #18 (left mandibular) and #28 (right maxillary) are present but **not impacted**.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **#15 (left first premolar)**:  
   - Suspicious for **periapical radiolucency**.  
   - Suspicious for **caries** on the mesial surface.  
2. **#11 (left lateral incisor)**:  
   - Evidence of **calculus deposition**.  
3. **#25 (right first molar)**:  
   - Suspicious for **caries** in the distal aspect.  
4. **Near #28 (right maxillary molar)**:  
   - Clear indication of an **impacted tooth** in the posterior region.  
5. **Near #27 (right second molar)**:  
   - Suspected **caries** in the interproximal area.  
6. **Near #17 (right first molar)**:  
   - Areas of concern for **caries** on both the mesial and distal aspects.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **Near #35 (left second molar)**:  
   - Presence of a **root canal-treated (rc-treated) tooth** with a **restoration**.  
2. **Near #25 (right first molar)**:  
   - **Crown** placement noted, with evidence of prior root canal treatment.  
3. **Near #15 (left first premolar)**:  
   - **Crown** placement and **root canal-treated tooth** documented.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted tooth near #28** requires clinical evaluation for extraction planning.  
2. **Periapical radiolucency on #15** suggests possible endodontic pathology, necessitating further investigation.  
3. **Multiple suspicious carious lesions** near #17, #25, and #27 demand early intervention.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce **oral hygiene protocols** to manage calculus deposition on #11.  
- Monitor **suspected caries** near #17 and #27 with frequent recalls.  
- Advise **fluoride application** for high-risk caries areas.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to endodontist** for assessment of #15 and #28.  
- **6-month recall** for monitoring carious lesions and impacted tooth status.  
- **Dental hygiene session** to address calculus and biofilm control.
