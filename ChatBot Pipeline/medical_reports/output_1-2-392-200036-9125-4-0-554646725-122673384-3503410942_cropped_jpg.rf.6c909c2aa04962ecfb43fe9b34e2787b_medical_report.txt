**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
1. **Priority Concerns**  
   - **Impacted tooth near #27** requires evaluation for potential surgical intervention.  
   - **Suspicious carious lesions near #46 and #36** necessitate confirmation via supplemental imaging or clinical examination to rule out active caries.  
   - **Suspicious impacted tooth near #17** should be monitored for signs of impaction or pericoronitis.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Reinforce meticulous oral hygiene practices, particularly around **#17, #36, and #46**.  
   - Advise dietary modifications to reduce caries risk in areas of concern.
