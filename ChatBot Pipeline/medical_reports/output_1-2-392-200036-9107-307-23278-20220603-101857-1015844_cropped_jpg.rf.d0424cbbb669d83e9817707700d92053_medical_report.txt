**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 25 teeth are visualized within the field of view, with no identifiable wisdom teeth (third molars) detected. The dental arches demonstrate adequate alignment, and no gross anatomical abnormalities are evident.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Tooth #26 (right upper first molar)**: A root stump is observed near the apical region, consistent with a prior extraction.  
- **Tooth #16 (right upper first molar)**: A suspicious area is noted in the occlusal region, suggesting early carious involvement (confidence < 80%). Further evaluation is recommended to confirm.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Tooth #47 (left lower second molar)**: A well-defined restoration is present in the occlusal surface.  
- **Tooth #25 (left upper second premolar)**: A restoration is identified in the mesial aspect, appearing intact.  
- **Tooth #36 (left upper first molar)**: A crown is visible, with no immediate signs of compromise.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Root stump near #26**: Residual apical bone suggests a prior extraction. Evaluate for signs of infection or resorption.  
2. **Suspected caries on #16**: Early occlusal demineralization requires confirmation via clinical examination to prevent progression.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interproximal cleaning around #16 and #26.  
- Monitor the suspicious carious lesion on #16 during routine checkups.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule a 6-month recall to reassess the status of #16 and #26.  
- Refer to a prosthodontist for further evaluation of the root stump at #26 if symptoms (e.g., pain, swelling) develop.  
- Consider supplemental imaging (e.g., bitewing radiograph) for definitive diagnosis of the suspicious caries on #16.
