**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---  

**Teeth-Specific Observations**  

1. **General Condition**  
   - A total of 25 teeth are visualized, demonstrating adequate anatomical clarity.  
   - All three wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #48) are present and non-impacted, with no evidence of pericoronal radiolucency or bony impaction.  
   - No significant radiographic abnormalities in periodontal ligament space or alveolar bone height.  

2. **Pathological Findings**  
   - **#47**: Area of concern noted for demineralization at the mesial aspect, suspicious for early caries.  
   - **#17**: Suspected carious lesion near the distal surface, requiring further evaluation.  
   - **Near #27**: Radiolucent area at the mesial root, suspicious for carious involvement.  
   - **Near #36**: Faint radiolucency at the distal root, consistent with caries or root canal therapy-related changes.  
   - **Near #37**: Two findings suspicious for impacted bony structures near the apical region; correlation with clinical examination is advised.  

3. **Historical Interventions**  
   - **#46**: Clear indication of root canal-treated tooth with apical radiolucency; presence of a crown noted.  
   - **Near #17**: Evidence of root canal therapy and a well-maintained crown.  
   - **Near #13**: Root canal-treated tooth with associated crown.  
   - **Near #22, #24, #27**: Root canal-treated teeth with crowns in varying states of preservation (scores ≥ 0.80).

**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

1. **Priority Concerns**  
   - **Near #37**: Suspected impacted bony structures require further imaging (e.g., CBCT) to assess extent and relation to adjacent teeth.  
   - **#47** and **#17**: High-priority caries suspicious findings necessitating clinical validation and intervention planning.  
   - **Near #27** and **#36**: Radiographic caries suspicious for progression; early restorative intervention is critical.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Reinforce patient education on biofilm control (e.g., interdental brushing, fluoride varnish application).  
   - Monitor areas of suspected calculus accumulation (no direct findings, but inferred from treatment history).  

3. **Follow-up Protocol**  
   - Schedule recall in **6 months** for reassessment of suspicious carious and bony lesions.  
   - Refer to endodontist for #46 due to persistent apical radiolucency.  
   - Consider CBCT imaging for #37 to clarify impacted findings and plan surgical intervention if indicated.
