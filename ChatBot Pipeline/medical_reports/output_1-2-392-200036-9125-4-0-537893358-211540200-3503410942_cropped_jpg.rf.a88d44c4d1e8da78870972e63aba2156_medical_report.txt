**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**

#### **1. General Condition**  
All 32 teeth are clearly visualized in the panoramic projection. Wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) are present and non-impacted. The dentition demonstrates full complement without evidence of congenital absence.  

#### **2. Pathological Findings**  
- **#17 (left first molar)**: Suspicious for early carious lesion in the proximal or occlusal surface.  
- **#46 (right first molar)**: Areas of concern noted near the interproximal region, suggesting potential carius involvement.  

#### **3. Historical Interventions**  
No restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants observed in the imaged field.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **#17 and #46**: Requires urgent evaluation for suspicious carious lesions to prevent progression.  
2. **#48 (left third molar)**: Visualized with reduced clarity; recommend supplemental imaging (e.g., periapical radiograph) to confirm position and integrity.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interproximal cleaning (flossing) for #17 and #46.  
- Monitor for calculus accumulation in posterior regions during routine cleanings.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule recall in **6 months** for reassessment of carious lesions and wisdom tooth #48.  
- Refer to general dentist for restorative intervention on #17 and #46 within **2 weeks**.  
- Consider orthodontic or surgical consultation for #48 if imaging reveals developmental anomalies.
