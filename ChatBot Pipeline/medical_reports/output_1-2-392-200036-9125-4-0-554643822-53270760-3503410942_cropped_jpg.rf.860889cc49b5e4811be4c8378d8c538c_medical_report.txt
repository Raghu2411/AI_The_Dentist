**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
- A total of 26 teeth are visualized within the field of view.  
- Wisdom teeth status:  
  - **#18 (lower left third molar)**: Fully erupted and not impacted.  
  - **#28 (lower right third molar)**: Impacted (horizontal orientation).  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **#28**: Clear indication of impacted lower right third molar.  
2. **Near #37**: Shows evidence of impacted structure in the apical region.  
3. **Near #47**: Areas of concern noted for impacted structure.  
4. **Near #47**: Suspicious for carious lesion in the proximal region.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **Near #12**: Presence of root canal-treated (RCT) tooth.  
2. **Near #16**: RCT confirmed.  
3. **Near #23**: RCT noted.  
4. **Near #34**: Evidence of restoration and RCT.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted lower right third molar (#28)** requires evaluation for surgical removal due to horizontal impaction.  
2. **Suspected carious lesion near #47** necessitates further diagnostic assessment (e.g., intraoral imaging).  
3. **Impacted structures near #37 and #47** may contribute to localized periodontal or carious pathology.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols for impacted molar regions (#28, #37, #47) to mitigate periodontal complications.  
- Monitor suspicious carious lesion near #47 with 6-month recall for progression.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
1. **Urgent Referral**: Surgical consultation for impacted #28.  
2. **6-Month Recall**: Re-evaluate carious lesion near #47 and impacted areas.  
3. **Endodontic Assessment**: Confirm RCT success for #12, #16, #23, and #34.
