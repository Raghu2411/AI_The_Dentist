**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  
1. **General Condition**  
   A total of 28 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field. All wisdom teeth (tooth #18 and #28) are present and unimpacted, exhibiting normal eruption patterns. No signs of periodontal disease or alveolar bone loss are observed.  

2. **Pathological Findings**  
   - Evidence of root stumps is noted near the following teeth:  
     - **Tooth #17** (upper right first molar): Clear indication of a residual root fragment.  
     - **Tooth #46** (lower right first molar): Radiopaque root stump with irregular margins.  
     - **Tooth #28** (lower right third molar): Radiopaque root remnant adjacent to the apical region.  
     - **Tooth #36** (lower left first molar): Dens-like radiopaque structure near the root apex.  
   - Areas of concern for carious lesions are identified near:  
     - **Tooth #36**: Suspicious for early caries between the mesial and distal surfaces.  
     - **Tooth #16** (upper left first molar): Radiolucent area suggests possible carious involvement.  
     - **Tooth #17**: Low-confidence radiolucency indicates potential caries on the distal surface.  
     - **Tooth #28**: Faint radiolucency raises suspicion for incipient caries on the mesial aspect.  

3. **Historical Interventions**  
   No restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
1. **Priority Concerns**  
   - Root stumps near **#17**, **#46**, **#28**, and **#36** require evaluation for potential endodontic or surgical intervention.  
   - Suspicious caries near **#36**, **#16**, **#17**, and **#28** necessitate further diagnostic validation (e.g., intraoral imaging) to confirm carious extent.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Reinforce oral hygiene practices to mitigate caries risk in high-risk areas.  
   - Monitor root stumps for signs of infection or resorption during subsequent visits.  

3. **Follow-up Protocol**  
   - **6-month recall** to reassess carious lesions and root stumps.  
   - **Referral to endodontist** for evaluation of root stumps and determination of treatment feasibility.  
   - Advise patient to maintain regular dental check-ups and consider professional scaling to address potential calculus accumulation.
