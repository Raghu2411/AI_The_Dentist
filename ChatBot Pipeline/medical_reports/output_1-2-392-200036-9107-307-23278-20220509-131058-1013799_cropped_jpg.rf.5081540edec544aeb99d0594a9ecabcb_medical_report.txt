**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

1. **General Condition**  
   - A total of **19 teeth** were visualized within the panoramic field.  
   - **Wisdom teeth status**: Tooth #48 (right lower third molar) is fully erupted and not impacted. No other wisdom teeth were identified as visible or impacted.  

2. **Pathological Findings**  
   - **Tooth #37 (right lower first molar)**:  
     - Clear indication of a **root stump** adjacent to the tooth.  
     - Suspicious for **caries** near the distal surface, requiring further diagnostic evaluation.  
   - **Tooth #48 (right lower third molar)**:  
     - Areas of concern noted for **proximal caries** near the mesial aspect.  

3. **Historical Interventions**  
   - **Tooth #25 (left lower second premolar)**: Presence of a **restoration** on the distal surface.  
   - **Tooth #22 (left upper lateral incisor)**: Evidence of **root canal treatment**.  
   - **Tooth #12 (right upper lateral incisor)**: Restorative material on the mesial surface.  
   - **Tooth #16 (right upper second molar)**: Restorative material on the distal surface.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

1. **Priority Concerns**  
   - **Root stump near tooth #37**: Immediate evaluation required to determine retention or extraction feasibility.  
   - **Suspected caries on tooth #37 and #48**: Urgent confirmation via clinical correlation and potential restorative intervention.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Reinforce oral hygiene protocols to mitigate caries progression in high-risk areas (#37, #48).  
   - Monitor for signs of secondary caries or periodontal compromise around existing restorations (#25, #12, #16).  

3. **Follow-up Protocol**  
   - **Referral to endodontist/prosthodontist** for assessment of root stump (#37) and suspected caries (#37, #48).  
   - **6-month recall** for radiographic and clinical review of all restorations and suspicious lesions.  
   - **Radiographic follow-up in 3 months** for caries near #37 and #48 to assess stability.
