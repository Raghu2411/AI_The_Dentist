**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---  
**Teeth-Specific Observations**  

1. **General Condition**  
   - **Visualized Teeth**: A total of 26 teeth are identified on the panoramic radiograph, including the lower right first molar (#38) and lower left third molar (#48).  
   - **Wisdom Teeth Status**: Both lower wisdom teeth (#38 and #48) are fully visualized and not impacted. No signs of impaction are observed for these teeth.  

2. **Pathological Findings**  
   - **Impacted Tooth**: A suspicious area near the upper left first premolar (#17) suggests a possible impacted structure.  
   - **Root Stumps**:  
     - Clear evidence of a root stump near the lower left third molar (#48).  
     - A root stump near the upper left first bicuspid (#15) noted.  
     - A suspicious root stump near the upper right second molar (#26).  
     - A root stump near the lower right third molar (#38) observed.  
   - **Caries**: A suspicious area suggestive of caries near the lower left first molar (#46) is identified.  

3. **Historical Interventions**  
   - No evidence of prior dental treatments (restorations, crowns, root canal therapy, or implants) is observed.

**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

1. **Priority Concerns**  
   - **Impacted Structure Near #17**: Requires evaluation for potential intervention.  
   - **Root Stumps Near #48, #15, and #38**: Clinical correlation and radiographic follow-up recommended to determine retention or removal.  
   - **Caries Near #46**: Immediate clinical assessment to confirm presence and initiate restorative treatment.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Reinforce oral hygiene practices, particularly around areas with suspicious findings (e.g., near #46 and #26).  
   - Monitor for progression of root stumps near #48, #15, and #38 during routine visits.  

3. **Follow-up Protocol**  
   - **Referral**: Oral surgeon evaluation for impacted structure near #17.  
   - **Endodontic Consultation**: For confirmation and management of suspicious caries near #46.  
   - **6-Month Recall**: For monitoring root stumps and ensuring no pathological changes.  
   - **Imaging Follow-up**: Repeat radiographic evaluation within 6–12 months for unresolved root stumps.
