**Oral Panoramic X-Ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **1. General Condition**  
A total of 26 teeth are visualized with clear anatomical landmarks. No wisdom teeth (third molars) are present in the arches. The dentition appears generally well-maintained, with no acute periapical radiolucencies or signs of advanced periodontal disease.  

#### **2. Pathological Findings**  
- **Sign of impacted tooth** near **#47** (mandibular right first molar).  
- **Evidence of impacted tooth** near **#27** (maxillary right first molar).  
- **Clear indication of impacted tooth** near **#37** (mandibular left first molar).  
- **Sign of impacted tooth** near **#17** (maxillary left first molar).  
- **Suspicious for impacted tooth** near **#24** (maxillary right first premolar), requiring further imaging confirmation due to lower confidence in localization.  

No carious lesions, calculus, or periapical pathology are identified.  

#### **3. Historical Interventions**  
No restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **Impacted teeth** near **#47**, **#27**, **#37**, and **#17** require urgent evaluation for surgical planning.  
- **Suspected impacted tooth** near **#24** warrants further diagnostic assessment due to indeterminate localization.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols to minimize periodontal risk around impacted areas.  
- Monitor for signs of infection or resorption adjacent to impacted teeth.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for evaluation of impacted teeth near **#47**, **#27**, **#37**, and **#17**.  
- **6-month recall** for follow-up imaging of suspicious area near **#24**.  
- Schedule **6-month recall** for general surveillance of periodontal health and impacted tooth progression.
