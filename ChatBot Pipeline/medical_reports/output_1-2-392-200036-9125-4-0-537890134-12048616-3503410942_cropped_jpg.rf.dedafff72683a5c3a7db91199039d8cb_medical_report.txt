**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

1. **Priority Concerns**  
   - Carious involvement is suspicious near #26 and #36. Immediate clinical evaluation is required to confirm diagnosis and initiate restorative treatment if needed.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Reinforce oral hygiene practices, including interdental cleaning, to mitigate progression of suspicious caries near #26 and #36.  
   - Monitor areas of concern during routine checkups to detect early signs of active decay.  

3. **Follow-up Protocol**  
   - Schedule a 6-month recall for radiographic and clinical reassessment of the suspicious carious lesions.  
   - Refer to a general dentist for definitive evaluation and treatment planning for #26 and #36.  
   - Reassess the restorative integrity of the restoration near #16 during the next recall.
