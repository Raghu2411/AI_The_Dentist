**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 28 teeth are visualized within the field of view. All erupted teeth demonstrate normal alignment and anatomical positioning. Wisdom teeth (third molars) are not visualized in the panoramic field. No evidence of supernumerary or missing teeth is noted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Impacted tooth** near **#27** (right maxillary second molar) with clear indication of partial bony obstruction.  
2. **Impacted tooth** near **#47** (left mandibular third molar) showing evidence of horizontal displacement.  
3. **Impacted tooth** near **#37** (left mandibular second molar) with signs of resorption of adjacent cortical bone.  
4. **Impacted tooth** near **#17** (right mandibular second molar) exhibiting radiographic features consistent with vertical impaction.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **Restoration** noted near **#36** (left mandibular first molar), likely corresponding to prior composite or amalgam placement.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **Impacted tooth near #27** requires evaluation for potential surgical removal due to proximity to adjacent molar.  
- **Impacted teeth near #47, #37, and #17** demonstrate radiographic features of bony impaction, necessitating orthopanographic correlation and clinical assessment for surgical planning.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce meticulous interdental cleaning (flossing/interdental brushes) to mitigate risk of caries in adjacent teeth.  
- Monitor for early signs of periodontal inflammation near impacted areas.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month radiographic recall** to assess progression of impacted teeth and adjacent bone integrity.  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for comprehensive evaluation of impacted #47, #37, and #17.  
- Schedule **follow-up clinical examination** in 3 months to evaluate soft tissue health around impacted regions.
