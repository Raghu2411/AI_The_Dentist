**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
A total of 22 teeth were visualized in the panoramic imaging. No wisdom teeth (third molars) were detected bilaterally. The remaining dentition demonstrates normal anatomical alignment and spatial relationships.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
No carious lesions, periapical radiolucencies, impacted teeth, or periodontal pathologies were identified in the examined dental structures.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Root canal-treated area** noted adjacent to tooth #14 (right maxillary first molar).  
- **Presence of a crown** observed near tooth #14, consistent with prior restorative intervention.

### **2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **Absence of wisdom teeth** detected bilaterally. No evidence of impaction or associated pathology.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- **Reinforce oral hygiene protocols** for the rc-treated area near #14 to prevent secondary caries.  
- **Monitor the crown** on #14 for signs of marginal breakdown or recurrent decay.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** recommended for ongoing surveillance of dental status and restorative durability.  
- **Referral to prosthodontist** advised to evaluate the stability and longevity of the crown on #14.
