**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
The panoramic radiograph visualizes a full complement of 32 teeth, with all permanent teeth accounted for in the FDI numbering system (11–48). All four wisdom teeth (18, 28, 38, and 48) are clearly visualized and **not impacted**, with normal angulation and sufficient osseous support. No signs of early tooth loss or supernumerary teeth are evident.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
No pathological abnormalities are detected. No carious lesions, periapical radiolucencies, periodontal bone loss, or impacted teeth are observed.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorative interventions (fillings, crowns, root canal treatments) or dental implants are evident in the field of view.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- No urgent or high-priority pathological findings identified.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce standard oral hygiene practices, including daily interdental cleaning and fluoride-containing toothpaste use.  
- Recommend a balanced diet with limited sugary intake to mitigate caries risk.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule a **6-month routine recall** for asymptomatic monitoring of periodontal health and caries prevention.  
- No immediate referral required. Maintain annual panoramic imaging for longitudinal assessment.
