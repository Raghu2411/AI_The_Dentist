**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 28 teeth are visualized, including all primary dentition. Wisdom teeth status:  
- **#18**: Non-impacted  
- **#28**: Non-impacted  
- **#38**: Non-impacted  
- **#48**: Impacted (horizontal orientation)  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Impacted wisdom tooth #48**: Clear indication of a horizontal impaction with no visible eruption pathway.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorative treatments (fillings, crowns, implants, or root canal therapies) are observed in the examined dentition.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **Impacted wisdom tooth #48**: Requires clinical evaluation for potential surgical intervention due to horizontal impaction and risk of adjacent structure compromise (e.g., inferior alveolar nerve).  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- **Oral hygiene reinforcement**: Emphasize interproximal cleaning techniques to mitigate future periodontal risk around impacted #48.  
- **Dietary counseling**: Recommend reduced sugar intake to prevent carious lesions in fully erupted teeth.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to oral surgeon**: For assessment of impacted #48 to determine surgical extraction feasibility and timing.  
- **6-month recall**: For radiographic and clinical monitoring of impacted #48 and adjacent teeth.  
- **Annual panoramic imaging**: To track any changes in impaction status or secondary pathology.
