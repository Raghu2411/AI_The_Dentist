**Oral Panoramic X-Ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 32 teeth are visualized. All four wisdom teeth (#08, #18, #28, #38) are present and unimpacted. The dental arches demonstrate normal alignment with no signs of gross malposition.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Suspected caries** noted near tooth #48 (FDI system) in the mesio-buccal aspect.  
- **Suspected caries** observed near tooth #26 (FDI system) in the distal surface.  
The low confidence scores for these findings suggest areas of concern requiring clinical correlation and additional imaging for definitive diagnosis.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior dental restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are evident.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Suspected caries near tooth #48**: Requires immediate clinical evaluation to confirm presence and extent.  
2. **Suspected caries near tooth #26**: Recommend further assessment to rule out early-stage decay.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- **Oral hygiene reinforcement**: Emphasize interdental cleaning (e.g., flossing, interproximal brushes) for areas around #48 and #26.  
- **Fluoride application**: Consider professional fluoride treatment to strengthen demineralized regions.  
- **Dietary counseling**: Limit sugar intake to reduce caries risk.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall**: Schedule for re-evaluation of suspicious carious lesions near #48 and #26.  
- **Referral to dentist**: For clinical confirmation and intervention if caries are confirmed.  
- **Annual panoramic imaging**: Monitor for new pathology or progression of existing concerns.
