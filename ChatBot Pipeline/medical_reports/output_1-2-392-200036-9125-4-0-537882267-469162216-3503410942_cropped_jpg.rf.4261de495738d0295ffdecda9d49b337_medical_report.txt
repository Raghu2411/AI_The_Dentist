**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 29 teeth were visualized, including all permanent dentition. The bilateral wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #48) were detected in non-impacted positions. No signs of gross alveolar resorption or developmental anomalies were observed.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Tooth #35**: Areas suspicious for periapical radiolucency were noted near the apical region.  
- **Tooth #47**: Suspected area of restoration material with possible carious involvement at the distal aspect.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Tooth #26**: Presence of a crown.  
- **Tooth #27**: Evidence of root canal treatment.  
- **Tooth #35**: Crown in place with associated root canal treatment.  
- **Tooth #47**: Fillings noted at the distal surface.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Periapical radiolucency near #35**: Requires further evaluation (e.g., CBCT) to assess apical pathology and determine treatment urgency.  
2. **Restoration integrity on #47**: Evaluate for secondary caries or marginal breakdown during clinical examination.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interproximal cleaning to prevent caries progression.  
- Monitor for signs of periodontal calculus accumulation in non-visualized interproximal regions.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to endodontist** for #35 to confirm periapical diagnosis and plan treatment.  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic monitoring of #47 restoration and #35 apical region.  
- Schedule immediate clinical assessment of #47 to verify restoration status.
