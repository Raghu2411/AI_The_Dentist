**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

**1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  

**General Condition**  
A total of 26 teeth are visualized within the field of view. Wisdom teeth (FDI 18, 28, 38, 48) are not detected, suggesting either absence or complete impaction. The dental arches demonstrate normal occlusal alignment with no evidence of fractures or acute trauma.  

**Pathological Findings**  
- Impacted tooth noted near #37 (left mandibular second molar).  
- Impacted tooth noted near #47 (right maxillary second molar).  
- Impacted tooth noted near #27 (left maxillary second molar).  
- Impacted tooth noted near #17 (right mandibular second molar).  

**Historical Interventions**  
- Presence of a crown on #16 (right mandibular first molar).  
- Presence of a crown on #26 (left maxillary first molar).

**2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
- Impacted teeth near #37, #47, #27, and #17 require evaluation for potential extraction or orthodontic intervention.  
- Crowns on #16 and #26 appear intact but should be monitored for secondary caries or marginal integrity issues.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce meticulous interproximal cleaning around impacted regions to mitigate pericoronitis risk.  
- Emphasize fluoride-based caries prevention for adjacent teeth in contact with impacted areas.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- Immediate referral to an oral surgeon for clinical and radiographic assessment of impacted teeth near #37, #47, #27, and #17.  
- Schedule 6-month recall for radiographic monitoring of impacted sites and crown status.  
- Consider panoramic imaging within 12 months to evaluate for resorption or positional changes in impacted teeth.
