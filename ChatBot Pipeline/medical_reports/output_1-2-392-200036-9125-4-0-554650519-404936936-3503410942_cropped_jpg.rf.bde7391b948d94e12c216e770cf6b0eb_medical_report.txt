**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
- **Total visualized teeth**: 28 teeth (FDI numbering system).  
- **Wisdom teeth status**: All four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) are present and unimpacted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **#47**: Suspicious for caries lateral to the tooth.  
2. **#45**: Suspicious for caries near the distal aspect.  
3. **#36**: Suspicious for caries adjacent to the mesial surface.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **#45**: Presence of a crown and root canal treatment.  
2. **#15**: Root canal treatment with an associated crown.  
3. **#24**: Root canal treatment and a crown on the distal surface.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- Areas of concern for caries near #47, #45, and #36 require clinical correlation and radiographic confirmation.  
- Unimpacted wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) should be monitored for potential future issues (e.g., decay, periodontal compromise).  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, particularly for regions near #45 and #47 to mitigate caries progression.  
- Advise regular fluoride application and dietary counseling to reduce cariogenic risk.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for monitoring suspicious caries and wisdom tooth health.  
- **Referral to general dentist** for definitive diagnosis and management of suspected caries.  
- **Annual panoramic imaging** to assess stability of unimpacted wisdom teeth and treated teeth (#15, #24, #45).
