**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of **27 visualized teeth** were identified on the panoramic radiograph. Wisdom teeth status: **#18 (maxillary left third molar)** and **#48 (mandibular right third molar)** are present and **not impacted**. The remaining wisdom teeth (#38, #18) are not visualized in the field.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Caries suspicious for**:  
  - **Near tooth #17 (maxillary left second molar)**: Focal radiolucent lesion suggests early carious involvement.  
  - **Near tooth #36 (mandibular right first molar)**: Area of concern for carious lesion adjacent to the tooth.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Tooth #34 (mandibular right first molar)**:  
  - **Restoration present**: Composite or amalgam restoration noted.  
  - **Root canal-treated (rc-treated)**: Radiographic evidence of endodontic therapy.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Suspected caries near #17 and #36**: Requires immediate clinical correlation to confirm carious involvement.  
2. **Root canal-treated status of #34**: Monitor for recurrent caries or apical pathology.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce patient education on interproximal plaque control, particularly near #17 and #36.  
- Emphasize regular fluoride application for caries-prone areas.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic reassessment of suspicious caries near #17 and #36.  
- **Dental hygiene appointment** to address calculus deposits (if detected clinically).  
- **Referral to endodontist** if pulp vitality testing confirms non-vitality of #34.
