**ORAL PANORAMIC X-RAY EXAMINATION REPORT**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **1. General Condition**  
A total of **10 teeth** were visualized with varying degrees of clarity. No wisdom teeth were detected in the field of view. The visualized teeth include #12, #13, #14, #15, #16, #21, #22, #45, and #45 (note: potential duplication in localization data for #15, #13, and #45).  

#### **2. Pathological Findings**  
- **Root stumps**:  
  - Clear indication of root stumps near tooth #15 (multiple locations).  
  - Root stumps near tooth #45 (multiple locations).  
  - Root stumps near tooth #16 (lower confidence; suspicious for residual fragments).  
- **Impacted tooth**:  
  - Suspicious for impacted tooth near tooth #16 (low confidence).  
- **Periapical radiolucency**:  
  - Area of concern noted near tooth #15, suggestive of periapical pathology.  

#### **3. Historical Interventions**  
No evidence of prior restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants was observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted tooth near #16**: Requires surgical evaluation to assess extraction feasibility.  
2. **Multiple root stumps near #15 and #45**: Indicates prior extractions; monitor for infection or bony irregularities.  
3. **Periapical radiolucency near #15**: Suggestive of apical pathology; confirm diagnosis via additional imaging.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene practices to prevent infection around root stumps.  
- Monitor suspicious areas near #16 for signs of resorption or impaction progression.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for evaluation of impacted tooth near #16.  
- **Endodontic consultation** for #15 to address periapical radiolucency.  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic monitoring of residual root stumps and bony healing.
