**ORAL PANORAMIC X-RAY EXAMINATION REPORT**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 31 teeth are visualized. All four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) are present and fully erupted without evidence of impaction. The dentition exhibits no signs of systemic pathology or gross anatomical anomalies.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
Suspicious for carious lesion near tooth #17. The region adjacent to this tooth shows radiolucent changes consistent with early caries, though the low confidence in this finding warrants further evaluation with supplemental imaging or clinical examination.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No historical dental interventions observed (e.g., restorations, crowns, implants, or root canal treatments).

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Suspicious carious lesion near #17**: Radiographic findings suggest a potential carious lesion adjacent to tooth #17. Given the low confidence in detection, this area requires clinical correlation.  
2. **Wisdom teeth status**: All four third molars are present and unimpacted; however, no prior treatment is noted, and routine monitoring is advised for future complications.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
1. Reinforce patient education on plaque control and caries prevention, particularly in the posterior regions.  
2. Advise dietary modifications to reduce sugar intake and promote remineralization of early lesions.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
1. **6-month recall** to monitor radiographic changes in the region near #17.  
2. **Referral to general dentist** for direct clinical examination and confirmation of carious lesion.  
3. Schedule a comprehensive periodontal evaluation during the next appointment to assess for hidden caries and interproximal decay.
