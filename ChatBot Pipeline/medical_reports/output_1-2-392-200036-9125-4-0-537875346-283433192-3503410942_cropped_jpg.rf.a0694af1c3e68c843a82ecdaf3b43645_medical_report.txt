**Oral Panoramic X-Ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

1. **General Condition**  
   - A total of **29 teeth** were visualized within the panoramic field.  
   - **Wisdom teeth**:  
     - #18, #28, and #38 are fully erupted and unimpacted.  
     - #48 (left maxillary third molar) is **impacted** with reduced visibility and positional deviation.  

2. **Pathological Findings**  
   - **#48**: Suspicious for impacted third molar with limited buccal cortical bone visualization.  
   - **Near #28**: Shows evidence of caries involving the mesial surface.  
   - **Near #15**: Suspicious for root stump in the apical region, likely remnants of prior extraction.  
   - **Near #46**: Suspicious for caries along the distal surface.  
   - **Near #36**: Suspicious for periapical radiolucency at the apical aspect, suggesting possible apical periodontitis.  
   - **Near #36**: Additional suspicious for caries on the distal surface.  

3. **Historical Interventions**  
   - No prior restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants were observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted wisdom tooth #48** requires clinical evaluation to assess treatment options (e.g., surgical extraction).  
2. **Active caries near #28** and **#36** necessitate prompt intervention to prevent progression.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interproximal cleaning for caries-prone regions (#28, #36, #46).  
- Monitor areas of suspected root stump (#15) for potential inflammatory complications.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for assessment of impacted #48.  
- **Restorative treatment planning** for caries at #28 and #36 within 2 weeks.  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic monitoring of periapical radiolucency near #36.
