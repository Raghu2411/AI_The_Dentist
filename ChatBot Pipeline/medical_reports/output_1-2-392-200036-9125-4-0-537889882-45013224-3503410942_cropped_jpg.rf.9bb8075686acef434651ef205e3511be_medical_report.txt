**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 32 individual teeth are visualized. All four wisdom teeth (FDI #18, #28, #38, #48) are present and not impacted. The remaining teeth demonstrate normal spatial orientation.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
No active pathological findings (e.g., caries, periapical radiolucency, or impacted teeth) are identified in the dataset.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **FDI #35**: Presence of a crown and root canal-treated tooth noted in proximity.

### **2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- No urgent pathological conditions detected. Prior dental interventions (root canal therapy and crown placement on #35) are stable but require ongoing maintenance.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene practices to prevent secondary caries or periodontal complications near restored teeth.  
- Monitor calculus accumulation during routine cleanings, particularly in posterior regions.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for routine assessment of dental health and stability of prior interventions.  
- Annual panoramic imaging recommended to monitor for asymptomatic pathologies.  
- Refer to an endodontist for reassessment of #35 if functional concerns arise.
