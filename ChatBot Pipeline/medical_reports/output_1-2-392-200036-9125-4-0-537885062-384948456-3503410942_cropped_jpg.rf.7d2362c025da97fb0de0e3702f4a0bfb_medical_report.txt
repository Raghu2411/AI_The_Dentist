**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

1. **Priority Concerns**  
   - Impacted lesion near tooth #47 necessitating radiographic correlation and clinical assessment.  
   - Suspected impacted pathology near tooth #17; urgency is moderate due to diagnostic uncertainty.  

2. **Preventive Measures**
