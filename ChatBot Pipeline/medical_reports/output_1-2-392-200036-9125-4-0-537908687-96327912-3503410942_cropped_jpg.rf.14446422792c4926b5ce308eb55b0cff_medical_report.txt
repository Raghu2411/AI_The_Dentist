**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
A total of 24 teeth were visualized with clear anatomical localization. All permanent teeth are present, and no wisdom teeth (#18, #38, #48, #28) were identified within the imaging field, suggesting agenesis or absence of third molars bilaterally.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **#13 (right maxillary lateral incisor)**: A radiolucent area suspicious for a root-stump near the apical region.  
- **#25 (left mandibular second molar)**: A sign of root-stump detected adjacent to the tooth, accompanied by suspicious areas for caries in the mesial aspect.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **#16 (left maxillary first molar)**: Evidence of root canal treatment and a crown restoration.  
- **#47 (left mandibular third molar)**: Presence of a restoration in the apical region, consistent with prior endodontic intervention.

### **2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Root-stump involvement**: Confirmed root-stump near #13 and #25 requires evaluation for potential extraction or retreatment.  
2. **Caries risk**: Suspicious mesial caries on #25 necessitates prompt assessment to prevent progression.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols for interproximal caries prevention, particularly in the #25 region.  
- Monitor radiolucent areas near #13 and #25 for changes in density or expansion.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule a 3-month recall for reassessment of pathological findings.  
- Referral to an endodontist is advised for detailed evaluation of root-stump pathology in #13 and #25.  
- Consider restorative intervention for caries on #25 if confirmed.
