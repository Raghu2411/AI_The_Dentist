**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**

---

### Teeth-Specific Observations  
#### **General Condition**  
A total of 20 teeth are visualized with clear spatial localization. All wisdom teeth (#18 and #38) are present and non-impacted. No evidence of supernumerary or missing teeth detected. The dental arches demonstrate normal alignment and bone support.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Clear indication of impacted tooth near #27** (FDI #27).  
- **Sign of caries noted near #17** (FDI #17), with additional suspicious radiolucencies near #18 (FDI #18) and #38 (FDI #38).  
- **Areas of concern for radiolucency near #24** (FDI #24) and #44 (FDI #44), suggestive of early caries.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Restoration with crown on #44** (FDI #44).  
- **Root canal-treated teeth near #44** and #17 (FDI #17).  
- **Crown placement on #34** (FDI #34) and **near #38** (FDI #38).  
- **Implant detected near #34** (FDI #34).

### Clinical Summary & Recommendations  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted tooth near #27** (FDI #27) requires evaluation for potential surgical removal.  
2. **Caries near #17** (FDI #17) and **radiolucency near #44** (FDI #44) necessitate prompt restorative intervention.  
3. **Suspected caries near #24** (FDI #24) and #38 (FDI #38) warrant further imaging for confirmation.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols to mitigate caries progression in #17, #24, and #44.  
- Monitor suspicious radiolucencies near #18 and #38 with regular recall visits.  
- Apply fluoride varnish or sealants to high-risk caries areas.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for clinical and radiographic reassessment of pathological findings.  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for surgical planning of impacted #27.  
- **Endodontic consultation** for caries on #17 and #44.  
- **Consider selective bitewing radiographs** to clarify caries near #24 and #38.
