**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
A total of 13 teeth are clearly visualized within the field of view. No wisdom teeth (third molars) are detectable, with no evidence of unerupted or impacted molars. The remaining dentition demonstrates acceptable positioning and alignment for the identified teeth.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **#26**: Clear indication of a root stump adjacent to the distal aspect of the tooth.  
- **#34**: Suspicious for a root stump near the mesial surface, requiring further diagnostic confirmation.  
- **#43**: Areas of concern noted for a potential root stump near the buccal aspect.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **#11**: Presence of a fully contoured crown with radiopaque margins.  
- **#21**: Crown restoration with intact internal structure and no signs of peri-crown radiolucency.

### **2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Root stumps near #26 (confirmed)**: Requires assessment for residual apical pathology or infection.  
2. **Unconfirmed root stumps near #34 and #43**: Suspected remnants of prior extractions or fractured roots; radiographic correlation is advised.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce meticulous interdental cleaning between #26 and adjacent teeth to mitigate biofilm accumulation.  
- Monitor radiolucencies near #34 and #43 for signs of secondary caries or periodontal involvement.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to periodontist/endodontist** for definitive evaluation of root stumps at #26, #34, and #43.  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic reassessment of suspicious areas.  
- **Digital subtraction radiography** recommended for longitudinal monitoring of #34 and #43 if clinical symptoms arise.
