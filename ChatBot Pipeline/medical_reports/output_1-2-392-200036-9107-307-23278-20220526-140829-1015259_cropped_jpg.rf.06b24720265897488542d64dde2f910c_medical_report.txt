**ORAL PANORAMIC X-RAY EXAMINATION REPORT**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
29 teeth are visualized within the imaging field. All three identified wisdom teeth (#18, #38, #48) are present and not impacted based on spatial analysis. No gross radiographic abnormalities are noted in the periodontal ligaments or alveolar bone architecture.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
A clear indication of a root stump is observed near tooth #27, consistent with a residual root fragment following prior extraction. No evidence of active caries, calculus, or periapical pathology is detected.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are observed within the imaging field.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **Root stump near #27**: Requires evaluation for potential removal to prevent periodontal complications.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols for interproximal areas, particularly near #27.  
- Emphasize regular fluoride application for caries prevention.  
- Monitor for early signs of periodontal disease given the proximity of the root fragment.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to oral surgeon**: For surgical extraction of the root stump near #27.  
- **6-month recall**: For radiographic and clinical reassessment post-intervention.  
- **Annual panoramic imaging**: To monitor for asymptomatic pathologies or changes in the bone structure.
