**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 30 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field, consistent with normal dental arch anatomy. All four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #37, #47) are present. Wisdom teeth #18 and #28 exhibit normal eruption without impaction, while #37 and #47 show positional abnormalities requiring further evaluation.  

---

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Sign of impacted structure** observed near tooth #47.  
2. **Suspicious for impacted structure** near tooth #37 (confidence < 0.80).  
3. **Suspicious for carious lesion** near tooth #18 (confidence < 0.80).  

---

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No evidence of prior dental treatments, including restorations, crowns, root canal therapy, or implants.  

---

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted structure near #47** requires clinical correlation to assess anatomical relationship and treatment planning.  
2. **Suspected impacted structure near #37** and **potential carious lesion near #18** necessitate close monitoring for progression.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene instructions, emphasizing interdental cleaning for impacted teeth (#37, #47) and caries-prone areas (#18).  
- Monitor radiographic changes in suspicious regions during follow-up visits.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for evaluation of impacted regions near #37 and #47.  
- **6-month recall** for caries assessment near #18 and re-evaluation of pathological findings.  
- **Digital imaging** (e.g., CBCT) recommended for detailed 3D analysis of #37/#47 impaction if clinical symptoms develop.
