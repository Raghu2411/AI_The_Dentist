**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 21 individual tooth structures are visualized within the panoramic projection. All four wisdom teeth (FDI #18, #28, #38, #48) are present and demonstrate non-impacted eruption states. No significant malpositions or gross radiographic artifacts disrupt the field of view.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **FDI #35**: Clear indication of a root-stump observed in proximity (near-tooth #35).  
- **FDI #46**: Areas of concern noted for potential caries and suspicious periapical radiolucency near #46. Further evaluation recommended for definitive diagnosis.  
- **FDI #44**: Suspicious for a root-stump near #44, though radiographic evidence is inconclusive.  
- **FDI #38**: Multiple low-confidence indicators of impacted tissue near #38; clinical correlation required to confirm pathology.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior dental interventions (restorations, implants, root canals) are identified on this panoramic radiograph.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Root-stump near #35**: Requires surgical evaluation for extraction or management of residual root fragments.  
2. **Periapical radiolucency near #46**: Suggests apical periodontitis; referral to an endodontist for pulp vitality testing and treatment planning is warranted.  
3. **Suspected caries near #46**: Immediate restorative intervention indicated to prevent endodontic compromise.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols for interproximal areas around #46 and #35 to mitigate secondary caries.  
- Monitor suspicious radiographic changes in proximity to #44 and #38 during routine recalls.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral**: Consultation with an endodontist within 2 weeks for #46.  
- **Recall**: Schedule 6-month monitoring for #35, #38, and #44 with intraoral radiographs as needed.  
- **Imaging**: Consider cone-beam CT for 3D assessment of the #38 region if clinical symptoms emerge.
