**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 11 teeth were visualized, with no evidence of erupting wisdom teeth. Detected teeth include #21, #23, #26, #31–33, #35–37, #41–43. The posterior mandibular region (#35–37) and maxillary left quadrant (#43) exhibit multiple restorative interventions.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **#43**: Suspicious for a root fragment near the apical region.  
2. **#43**: Areas of concern for periapical radiolucency extending into the apical area.  
3. **#35**: Suspected caries involving the proximal surface near the middle third.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **#43**: Evidence of multiple root canal-treated canals and associated coronal restorations (crown fragments).  
2. **#21**: Presence of root canal-treated canals with associated restorations.  
3. **#35**: Proximity to a crown structure.  
4. **#33**: Root canal-treated tooth with coronal restoration.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **#43**: Suspicious root fragment and periapical radiolucency require evaluation for residual root or apical pathology.  
- **#35**: Suspected caries necessitating visual and tactile confirmation.  
- **#21**: Existing root canal-treated tooth with potential for endodontic complications.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce meticulous oral hygiene practices, particularly around #43 and #35.  
- Monitor for recurrent caries or secondary caries in restored regions (#21, #43).  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Urgent**: Refer to endodontist for assessment of #43 periapical radiolucency and root fragment.  
- **Scheduled**: Recall in 6 months for re-evaluation of #35 caries and restorative status.  
- **Routine**: Annual recall for monitoring of root-treated teeth (#21, #43) and existing restorations.
