**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
A total of 28 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field with anatomical landmarks clearly defined. All permanent mandibular first molars (#16, #26, #36, #46) are present. The maxillary right third molar (#48) and maxillary left third molar (#38) are identified; both are fully erupted and not impacted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Sign of caries** noted on **#17** (distal aspect).  
- **Suspicious for caries** observed **near tooth #36** (mesial area).  
- **Areas of concern for caries** identified **near tooth #27** (buccal surface).  
- **Areas of concern for caries** noted **near tooth #16** (lingual surface).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Root canal-treated tooth** confirmed **near tooth #14** (mesio-apical region).  
- **Restoration (filling)** present **near tooth #14** (buccal-occlusal interface).

### **2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Confirmed caries on #17** requires immediate intervention to prevent progression.  
2. **Suspicious carious lesions near #36, #27, and #16** warrant further diagnostic evaluation.  
3. **Root canal-treated tooth #14** should be monitored for secondary caries or apical pathology.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce biofilm control measures, emphasizing interproximal cleaning for #36 and #16.  
- Advise dietary counseling to reduce cariogenic exposure in high-risk areas.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic reassessment of questionable caries.  
- **Referral to general dentist** for definitive treatment planning on #17 and #36.  
- **Endodontic evaluation** recommended for #14 to confirm root canal treatment efficacy.
