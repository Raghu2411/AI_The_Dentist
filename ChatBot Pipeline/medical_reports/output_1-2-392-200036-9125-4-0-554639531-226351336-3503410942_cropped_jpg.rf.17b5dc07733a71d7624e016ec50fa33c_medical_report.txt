**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

1. **General Condition**  
   A total of 31 teeth were visualized, with all primary maxillary and mandibular teeth accounted for. All detected wisdom teeth (#38, #28) demonstrate normal eruption and alignment without impaction. The maxillary third molar (#18) was identified with a detection confidence of 0.68; however, its non-impacted status per recorded data remains unverified due to reduced visibility.  

2. **Pathological Findings**  
   A clear indication of impacted osseous tissue was observed near tooth #47. This radiographic opacity suggests developmental disturbance or bony sequestration in proximity to the distal root of the maxillary second molar. No other carious lesions, periapical pathology, or periodontal defects were identified.  

3. **Historical Interventions**  
   No evidence of restorative treatments, root canal therapy, crowns, or implants was detected in the field of view.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

1. **Priority Concerns**  
   - Impacted osseous tissue near #47 requires evaluation for potential surgical intervention or monitoring for resorption risk to adjacent teeth.  
   - Suboptimal visualization of #18 warrants confirmation via supplemental imaging (e.g., CBCT) to assess for impacted status or other pathology.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Reinforce meticulous oral hygiene practices to mitigate periodontal risk in the #47 region.  
   - Monitor for signs of infection or occlusal discomfort near the impacted area during routine recall visits.  

3. **Follow-up Protocol**  
   - Schedule a 6-month follow-up with panoramic and/or CBCT imaging to track progression of the impacted lesion near #47.  
   - Refer to an oral surgeon for definitive diagnosis and management of the #47 pathology.  
   - Re-evaluate #18 status via high-resolution imaging if clinical symptoms develop.
