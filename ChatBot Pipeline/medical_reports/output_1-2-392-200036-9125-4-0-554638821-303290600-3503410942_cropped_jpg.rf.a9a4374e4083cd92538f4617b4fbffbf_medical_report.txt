**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of **23 teeth** were visualized, with no evidence of supernumerary teeth. Wisdom teeth status reveals **tooth #38 (lower right third molar)** is fully erupted and unimpacted. No other third molars were visualized.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
Multiple suspicious radiolucent areas are noted **near tooth #47 (lower left third molar)**, consistent with **periapical radiolucency**. These findings suggest potential apical pathology or residual infection. No other teeth demonstrate carious lesions, impactions, or significant periodontal pathology.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Tooth #47**: Presence of a **crown** and **root canal treatment (RCT)**.  
- **Near tooth #24 (upper left first molar)**: Crown and RCT noted.  
- **Near tooth #36 (lower left first molar)**: Crown and RCT observed.  
- **Near tooth #38 (lower right third molar)**: Crown and RCT documented.  
- **Near tooth #47**: Additional crown and RCT identified adjacent to the existing restoration.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **Apical pathology near #47**: Multiple radiolucent areas suggest possible apical periodontitis or residual infection despite prior RCT.  
- **Historical interventions on #47**: Repeated restorations indicate high-risk tooth requiring endodontic re-evaluation.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce **oral hygiene protocols** to prevent secondary caries around existing crowns (#24, #36, #38, #47).  
- Monitor for **calculus accumulation** in interproximal regions, particularly near posterior crowns.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Urgent referral to an endodontist** for evaluation of apical radiolucency near #47 and assessment of prior RCT success.  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic review of apical changes and crown integrity.  
- Consider **cone-beam CT (CBCT)** for 3D assessment of periapical pathology if clinical symptoms (e.g., pain, swelling) arise.
