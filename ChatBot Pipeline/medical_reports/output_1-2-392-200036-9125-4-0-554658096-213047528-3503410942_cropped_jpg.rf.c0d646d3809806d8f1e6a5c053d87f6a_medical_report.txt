**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 21 teeth were visualized on the panoramic radiograph. The maxillary and mandibular arches demonstrate intact dentition with no evidence of extensive bone resorption. Wisdom tooth #38 (FDI) is fully erupted and not impacted. Other third molars (#18, #28, #48) are not visualized, suggesting possible absence or radiographic overlap.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Root stump** near tooth #17 (FDI) is clearly visible, indicating prior extraction or resorption.  
2. **Areas of concern for caries** are noted near tooth #17, with radiolucency involving the proximal surface; further diagnostic evaluation is warranted due to low confidence in localization.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **Tooth #46**: Presence of a crown and evidence of root canal therapy.  
2. **Restoration** adjacent to tooth #15 (likely involving #16 or #14).  
3. **Restoration** near tooth #38 (likely addressing mesial or distal surfaces).  
4. **Root canal-treated tooth** near #22 (likely involving #21 or #23).  
5. **Restoration** adjacent to tooth #24 (likely addressing #23 or #25).

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Root stump near #17**: Requires clinical correlation to assess healing status or potential for infection.  
2. **Suspected caries near #17**: Immediate clinical evaluation and possibly small-bore radiography to confirm caries depth.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
1. **Monitor areas of suspected calculus** in the posterior mandible (near #17) during routine hygiene visits.  
2. **Oral hygiene reinforcement** for interproximal areas, particularly around #17 and #22.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
1. **6-month recall** for radiographic monitoring of caries near #17 and root stump status.  
2. **Referral to endodontist** for evaluation of #22 (nearby RC-treated area) if clinical symptoms arise.  
3. **Restorative evaluation** for existing restorations near #15, #24, and #38 to ensure integrity and occlusal adaptation.
