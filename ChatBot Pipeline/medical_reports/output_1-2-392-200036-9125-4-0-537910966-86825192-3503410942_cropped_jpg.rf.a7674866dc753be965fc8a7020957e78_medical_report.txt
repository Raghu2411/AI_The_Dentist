**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
The panoramic image visualizes 23 teeth, including two non-impacted wisdom teeth (#18 and #48). No evidence of impaction or agenesis noted. Visualized teeth exhibit normal positioning and morphological integrity.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **#48 (mandibular right 3rd molar):** Area of concern for carious lesion identified at the mesial aspect.  
- **#35 (maxillary left 2nd molar):** Suspicious radiolucency noted at the distal surface, suggestive of early carious involvement.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **#18 (mandibular right 3rd molar):** Evidence of root canal therapy with a coronal crown restoration.  
- **#24 (mandibular left 1st molar):** Presence of root canal-treated tooth with a full-coverage crown.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Suspected carious lesions near #48 and #35** require clinical correlation and confirmation via intraoral imaging (e.g., bitewing radiographs).  
2. **Monitor root canal-treated #18 and #24** for signs of secondary caries or apical pathology during routine evaluations.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interdental cleaning (interdental brushes/floss) for #48 and #35.  
- Advise dietary counseling to reduce cariogenic exposure in high-risk areas.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule 6-month recall for radiographic and clinical reassessment of carious areas near #48 and #35.  
- Consider recall for crown condition on #24, with evaluation for marginal integrity.  
- Referral to general dentist or endodontist for definitive management of suspicious caries if confirmed.
