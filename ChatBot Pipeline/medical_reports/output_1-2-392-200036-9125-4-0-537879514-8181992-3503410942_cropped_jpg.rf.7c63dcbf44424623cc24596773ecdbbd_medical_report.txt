**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of **15 teeth** are visualized within the panoramic field. All three identified wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38) are **present and erupting unimpeded** with no evidence of impaction.  

---

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Sign of root stumps** noted **near #35**, **near #33**, **near #27**, and **near #45**.  
- **Sign of root stumps** observed **near #23**.  
- **Suspicious for carious lesions** **near #18** and **near #23**.  
- **Suspicious for residual root stumps** **near #23** (lower confidence).  

---

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Root canal-treated teeth** identified **near #23** (multiple radiopaque markers), **near #18**, **near #12**, **near #13**, and **near #41**.  
- **Presence of a crown** on **near #12**.  
- **Restorative material** detected **near #13**.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Residual root stumps** near #35, #33, #27, #45, and #23 require evaluation for potential extraction or guided tissue regeneration.  
2. **Caries suspicion** near #18 and #23 demands immediate diagnostic correlation (e.g., clinical examination, ICDT if indicated).  
3. **Endodontic follow-up** warranted for root canal-treated teeth (#23, #18, #12, #13, #41) to confirm periapical healing.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce **oral hygiene protocols** to mitigate caries risk in #18 and #23.  
- Monitor **suspected root stumps** near #45 and #27 for signs of infection or bony resorption.  
- Address **calculus deposits** in anterior regions (visually inferred from radiographic density).  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for reassessment of root stumps and caries progression.  
- **Referral to endodontist** for evaluation of root canal-treated #12 and #13.  
- **Consultation with periodontist** for surgical management of residual root stumps near #35 and #33.
