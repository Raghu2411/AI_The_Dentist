**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 24 teeth are visualized within the field of view. All identified wisdom teeth (#28 maxillary right third molar and #48 mandibular left third molar) are fully erupted and not impacted. No significant malpositioning or agenesis is observed.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Caries**: An area of concern is noted near tooth #16 (mandibular right first molar), suggesting early carious involvement. The lesion demonstrates radiolucency adjacent to the mesial surface, consistent with interproximal decay.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Restorations**:  
  - Restoration identified near tooth #26 (maxillary right first molar).  
  - Restoration near tooth #21 (maxillary central incisor).  
  - Restoration near tooth #37 (mandibular right second molar).  
  - Restoration near tooth #47 (mandibular left second molar).  
  - Restoration near tooth #16 (mandibular right first molar).  
  - Restoration near tooth #28 (maxillary right third molar).  
- **Root Canal Treatments (RC-treated)**:  
  - RC-treated tooth noted near #25 (maxillary right second molar).  
  - RC-treated tooth near #15 (maxillary left first premolar).

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Early caries near #16**: Requires evaluation for potential restorative intervention.  
2. **Restoration status**: Assess integrity of existing restorations on #21, #26, #37, #47, and #28 to rule for secondary caries or marginal breakdown.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interdental cleaning for caries-prone areas (e.g., near #16).  
- Monitor RC-treated teeth (#25, #15) for signs of apical pathology or periapical rarefaction.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule **6-month recall** for clinical and radiographic reassessment of the suspicious carious lesion near #16.  
- Refer to endodontist for further evaluation of #25 and #15 if apical radiolucency is detected on follow-up.  
- Consider selective radiographic isolation (e.g., bitewing) to clarify interproximal restorations requiring verification.
