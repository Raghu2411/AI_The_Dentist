**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 22 teeth are visualized. The lower right third molar (#48) and lower left third molar (#38) are present but not impacted. All other teeth demonstrate normal alignment and anatomical relationships.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Root stumps** show evidence of residual root fragments near tooth #24 (multiple lesions), #11, and #15.  
2. A suspicious area of periapical radiolucency is noted near tooth #15.  
3. A suspicious root stump is identified adjacent to tooth #23.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Residual root fragments** near #24 (#23-24 interproximal region) require evaluation for potential infection or foreign body reaction.  
2. **Periapical radiolucency near #15** suggests possible apical pathology (e.g., apical cyst or granuloma); further diagnostic imaging (e.g., CBCT) is warranted.  
3. **Root stumps adjacent to #11 and #23** indicate prior extractions; monitor for inflammatory changes.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
1. Reinforce oral hygiene protocols for interproximal areas near #15 and #24 to mitigate biofilm accumulation.  
2. Educate on the importance of regular recall visits to monitor residual root fragments and prevent secondary complications.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
1. **6-month recall** for radiographic re-evaluation of the periapical lesion near #15 and root stumps.  
2. **Referral to an endodontist** for definitive management of the apical radiolucency near #15.  
3. **Referral to a periodontist** to assess the need for surgical removal of residual root fragments near #24 and #11.
