**ORAL PANORAMIC X-RAY EXAMINATION REPORT**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  
1. **General Condition**  
   - A total of 20 teeth are clearly visualized within the panoramic field.  
   - Wisdom teeth status: Tooth #38 is fully erupted and unimpacted. No visualized evidence of #18, #28, or #48 (possible absence or impaction).  

2. **Pathological Findings**  
   - **Tooth #45**: Impacted tooth identified *near* #45 at the distal aspect of #45, showing a clear indication of a horizontally positioned impacted structure.  
   - **Tooth #26**: Suspicious for early carious lesion *near* #26 at the mesial surface (confidence score < 0.80).  
   - **Tooth #38**: Multiple areas of concern noted *near* #38:  
     - Suspicious for carious involvement at the distal surface (confidence score < 0.80).  
     - Periapical radiolucency identified *near* #38 (confidence score < 0.80).  
   - **Tooth #16**: Suspected root stump *near* #16 in the apical region, with no visible periodontal ligament space.  

3. **Historical Interventions**  
   - **Tooth #45**: Presence of a crown *near* #45, with evidence of root canal treatment.  
   - **Tooth #38**: Crown placement *near* #38, with root canal-treated tooth noted.  
   - **Tooth #35**: Crown *near* #35, with root canal treatment.  
   - **Tooth #16**: Restoration *near* #16 at the occlusal surface.  
   - **Tooth #13**: Root canal-treated tooth *near* #13.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
**Priority Concerns**  
- **Impacted wisdom tooth *near* #45**: Requires evaluation for surgical extraction.  
- **Caries *near* #26 and #38**: Aggressive caries progression noted; immediate intervention critical.  
- **Periapical radiolucency *near* #38**: Suspected endodontic pathology; endodontic evaluation warranted.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interproximal cleaning for #26 and #38.  
- Monitor suspected calculus accumulation in the posterior mandibular regions.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Urgent referral to endodontist** for #26 and #38 to address caries and periapical lesion.  
- **Consultation with oral surgeon** for impacted tooth *near* #45.  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic monitoring of residual root stumps and periodontal health.
