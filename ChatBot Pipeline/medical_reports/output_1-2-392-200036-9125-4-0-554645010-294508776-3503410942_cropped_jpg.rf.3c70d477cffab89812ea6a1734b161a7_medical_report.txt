**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 29 teeth are visualized, including all four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48), which are unimpacted and fully erupted. The dentition demonstrates adequate alignment and spacing, with no evidence of fractures or luxation.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Suspicious for carious lesion** near tooth #26 (lower left first molar).  
2. **Areas of concern noted for carious involvement** near tooth #47 (upper left third molar).  
3. **Areas of concern noted for carious involvement** near tooth #23 (lower left first premolar).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
1. **Root canal-treated tooth** noted near #26.  
2. **Root canal-treated tooth** noted near #36 (upper left first molar).  
3. **Root canal-treated tooth** noted near #23.  
4. **Restoration** observed near #38 (upper right third molar).  
5. **Crown** present on #26.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **High-priority**: Suspicious carious lesion near #26 requires further clinical correlation and radiographic assessment.  
- **Monitoring required**: Areas of concern near #47 and #23 warrant close follow-up due to potential carious progression.  
- **Restorative review**: Confirm integrity of the crown on #26 and evaluate for secondary caries at margins.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce patient education on interproximal plaque control, particularly around #26, #23, and #47.  
- Apply fluoride varnish to vulnerable surfaces (e.g., #26, #47) to mitigate caries risk.  
- Schedule regular recall appointments for early detection of carious activity.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Immediate follow-up**: Refer to general dentist for confirmation of caries near #26, #23, and #47.  
- **6-month recall**: Monitor restorative outcomes for the crown on #26 and stability of root canal-treated teeth (#23, #26, #36).  
- **Referral to endodontist**: Consider for evaluation of #26 if symptoms of apical pathology emerge.
