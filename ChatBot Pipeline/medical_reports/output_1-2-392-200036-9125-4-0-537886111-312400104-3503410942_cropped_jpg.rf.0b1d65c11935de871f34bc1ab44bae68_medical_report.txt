**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 28 permanent teeth are visualized. All wisdom teeth are present: **#48 (right lower third molar)** and **#28 (left lower third molar)** are fully erupted with no evidence of impaction. No congenital absence of deciduous teeth or supernumerary teeth is noted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Clear indication of residual root fragment** near **#25 (left upper second molar)**.  
- **Evidence of residual root fragment** near **#37 (left lower first molar)**.  
- **Suspicious lesion consistent with carious lesion** near **#27 (left lower second molar)**.  
- **Areas of concern noted for potential carious involvement** near **#37 (left lower first molar)**.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Restorative material present** near **#15 (left upper lateral incisor)**.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Residual root fragments** near **#25** and **#37** require radiographic correlation and surgical evaluation to confirm their relationship to adjacent anatomical structures.  
2. **Suspected caries** near **#27** and **#37** necessitate close monitoring for progression or clinical correlation.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce biofilm control measures (e.g., interdental brushes, fluoride varnish) to mitigate caries risk in high-risk areas.  
- Educate on systemic health impacts of retained root fragments (e.g., infection, resorption risks).  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for assessment of residual root fragments near **#25** and **#37**.  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic monitoring of suspicious carious lesions.  
- **Dedicated caries risk assessment** and targeted remineralization therapy for **#27** and **#37**.
