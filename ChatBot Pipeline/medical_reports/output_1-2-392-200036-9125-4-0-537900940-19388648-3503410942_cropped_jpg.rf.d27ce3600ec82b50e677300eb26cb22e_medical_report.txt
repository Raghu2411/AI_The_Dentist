**Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

1. **Priority Concerns**  
   - Caries suspicious near #18 requires immediate evaluation for potential conservative intervention.  
   - Monitor integrity of restoration and root canal-treated #23 for recurrent caries or secondary infection.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interproximal cleaning near #18.  
   - Counsel on fluoride application and dietary modifications to mitigate caries risk.  

3. **Follow-up Protocol**  
   - Schedule a follow-up within 2 weeks for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning of #18.  
   - 6-month recall for radiographic re-evaluation of #23.  
   - Referral to endodontist if root canal-treated #23 exhibits signs of apical pathology.
