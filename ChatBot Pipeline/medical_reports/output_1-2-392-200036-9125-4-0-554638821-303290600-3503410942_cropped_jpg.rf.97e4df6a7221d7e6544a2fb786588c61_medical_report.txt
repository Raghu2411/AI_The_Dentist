**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of 24 teeth are visualized within the radiographic field. The maxillary and mandibular dentitions appear generally intact with no evidence of significant attrition or malposition. Wisdom tooth #38 is fully erupted and unimpacted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
Suspicious areas of periapical radiolucency are noted in the apical region **near tooth #47**, consistent with possible apical periodontitis. While multiple overlapping findings are identified, the low confidence associated with these observations necessitates further evaluation to confirm the extent of pathology.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- Presence of a crown on **#47** and **#46**.  
- Evidence of root canal treatment (RC-treated) with a superimposed crown on **#38** and **#36**.  
- A restoration is observed **near tooth #38**.  
- A crown with RC-treated root structure is documented **near tooth #24**.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Periapical radiolucency near #47**: Requires evaluation for apical periodontitis or endodontic pathology.  
2. **Historical RC-treated teeth (#36, #38, #24)**: Monitor for signs of secondary caries or apical flare-ups.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols to reduce biofilm accumulation around restored teeth (#47, #46, #38).  
- Educate on dietary modifications to minimize caries risk in non-restored teeth.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic monitoring of periapical changes near **#47**.  
- **Referral to endodontist** for diagnostic assessment of **#47** due to suspicious periapical findings.  
- Schedule **3-month recall** for teeth with prior RC treatment (**#36, #38, #24**) to evaluate for complications.
