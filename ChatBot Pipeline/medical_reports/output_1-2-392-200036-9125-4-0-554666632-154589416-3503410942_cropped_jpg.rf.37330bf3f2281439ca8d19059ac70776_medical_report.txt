**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
All 32 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field. Wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38) are present and unimpacted. No evidence of missing or supernumerary teeth is noted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Tooth #47 (lower left first molar):** Suspicious for impacted molar near tooth #47.  
- **Tooth #28 (upper right first molar):** Areas of concern noted for caries near tooth #28 (two distinct regions).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorative or endodontic treatments, crowns, implants, or other interventions are observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Suspicious impacted molar near #47** (lower left quadrant): Requires evaluation for potential developmental anomalies or space management.  
2. **Caries-like lesions near #28** (upper right quadrant): Requires further diagnostic assessment (e.g., intraoral imaging) to confirm carious involvement or early demineralization.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce patient education on plaque control and interproximal cleaning techniques for the upper right quadrant.  
- Monitor suspicious areas near #28 and #47 during routine recalls for progression or resolution.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- Schedule a 6-month recall for clinical and radiographic reassessment of findings near #28 and #47.  
- Refer to a specialist (e.g., oral surgeon or endodontist) if caries near #28 require restorative intervention or if the impacted molar near #47 necessitates orthodontic/periodontal evaluation.
