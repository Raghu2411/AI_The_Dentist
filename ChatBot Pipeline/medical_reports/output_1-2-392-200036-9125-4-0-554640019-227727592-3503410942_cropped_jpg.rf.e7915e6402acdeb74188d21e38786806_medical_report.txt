**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
- A total of **29 teeth** were visualized within the field of view.  
- All four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) are present and **non-impacted**, with normal alveolar bone support.  
- No evidence of tooth loss or supernumerary teeth detected.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **Suspicious for a root stump** localized near tooth #25. The radiographic appearance suggests a residual root fragment or incomplete extraction, requiring clinical correlation.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **Root canal-treated regions** noted adjacent to:  
  - Tooth #15 (presence of a crown).  
  - Tooth #34 (presence of a crown).  
  - Tooth #25 (no restoration observed).  
- **Crown restorations** identified on:  
  - Tooth #15 (combined with root canal treatment).  
  - Tooth #47.  
  - Tooth #34 (combined with root canal treatment).

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **Suspicious root stump near #25** requires clinical evaluation to confirm etiology and plan for definitive management (e.g., surgical removal or monitoring).  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- **Reinforce oral hygiene protocols** around restored teeth (#15, #34, #47) to prevent secondary caries or periodontal complications.  
- **Monitor radiolucency** near #25 during follow-up appointments for signs of infection or resorption.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic and clinical reassessment of the suspicious root fragment near #25.  
- **Referral to endodontist** or oral surgeon if symptoms (e.g., pain, swelling) develop or if surgical intervention is warranted.  
- **Reinforce professional scaling** to address potential calculus buildup, particularly in posterior regions.
