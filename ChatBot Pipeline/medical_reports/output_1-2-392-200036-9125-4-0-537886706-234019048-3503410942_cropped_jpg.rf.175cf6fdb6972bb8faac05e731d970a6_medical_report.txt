**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

**1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  

**General Condition**  
A total of 26 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field. Wisdom teeth (#38, #48, #18) are present and unimpacted. No evidence of gross alveolar bone loss or periodontal pathology is observed.  

**Pathological Findings**  
- A clear indication of a **root-stump** is present near tooth #44.  
- A suspicious lesion suggests **caries** near tooth #38.  
- Areas of concern for **periapical radiolucency** are noted adjacent to tooth #36 (2 findings) and near tooth #44. These findings demonstrate low diagnostic confidence and warrant further evaluation.  

**Historical Interventions**  
- A restorative filling is confirmed near tooth #36.  
- A dental implant is present near tooth #17.

**2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
1. Root-stump near #44 requiring extraction or orthodontic evaluation.  
2. Suspected caries near #38 necessitating clinical correlation and intervention.  
3. Periapical radiolucency near #36 and #44 demanding endodontic assessment due to potential apical pathology.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interdental cleaning near #38 and #36.  
- Monitor suspicious caries near #38 with 6-month recall imaging.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
1. **Referral to endodontist** for evaluation of periapical radiolucencies near #36 and #44.  
2. **Referral to prosthodontist** for assessment of implant stability near #17.  
3. Schedule **6-month recall** for radiographic monitoring of caries and periapical changes.
