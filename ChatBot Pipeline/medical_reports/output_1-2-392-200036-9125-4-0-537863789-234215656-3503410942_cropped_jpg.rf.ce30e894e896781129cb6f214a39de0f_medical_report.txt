**ORAL PANORAMIC X-RAY EXAMINATION REPORT**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of **29 teeth** are visualized. No wisdom teeth (FDI 18/28/38/48) are present in the field of view.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Impacted tooth noted near #17** (left mandibular first molar).  
2. **Impacted tooth noted near #37** (right maxillary first molar).  
3. **Impacted tooth noted near #47** (left mandibular third molar).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants are observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. Impacted tooth near #17 (left mandibular first molar) may require surgical evaluation to assess positional risks to adjacent teeth.  
2. Impacted tooth near #37 (right maxillary first molar) warrants orthopantomographic correlation to clarify potential effects on occlusion and adjacent structures.  
3. Impacted tooth near #47 (left mandibular third molar) should be evaluated for eruption potential or surgical removal indications.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce meticulous oral hygiene in the regions adjacent to impacted teeth to mitigate periodontal complications.  
- Emphasize dietary modifications to reduce caries risk in areas near impacted teeth.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for comprehensive assessment of impacted teeth at #17, #37, and #47.  
- **6-month recall scheduling** to monitor impacted tooth progression and assess for secondary complications.  
- Consider **cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)** for detailed 3D imaging if surgical intervention is indicated.
