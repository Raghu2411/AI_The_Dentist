**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

**1. General Condition**  
A total of 25 teeth are visualized within the field of view. The fully erupted wisdom teeth (FDI #28) are present and not impacted. The panoramic field demonstrates adequate clarity for diagnostic evaluation.  

**2. Pathological Findings**  
- **Sign of impacted tooth** near FDI #37 (score ≥ 0.80).  
- **Sign of impacted tooth** near FDI #47 (score ≥ 0.80).  
- **Suspicious for caries** noted near FDI #37 (score < 0.80).  
- **Areas of concern noted for caries** near FDI #37 (score < 0.80).  
- **Areas of concern noted for root-stump** near FDI #45 (score < 0.80).  

**3. Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorative or endodontic treatments identified in the radiographic field.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

**Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted tooth near #37** requires surgical evaluation for potential extraction.  
2. **Suspected caries at #37** warrants confirmation via supplemental imaging and caries management.  
3. **Impacted tooth near #47** should be assessed for developmental abnormalities or space maintenance needs.  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce **oral hygiene protocols** to mitigate caries progression at #37.  
- Monitor **areas of suspected calculus** (not explicitly localized in data) for periodontal health.  
- Schedule **3-month review** for impacted teeth to assess positional changes.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Urgent referral to oral surgeon** for impacted #37 and #47.  
- **Endodontic evaluation** if sensitivity or mobility develops at #37.  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic surveillance of caries and root-stump near #45.  
- Consider **digital subtraction radiography** for longitudinal monitoring of suspicious areas.
