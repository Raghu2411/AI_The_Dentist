**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **1. Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
- **Total visualized teeth**: 25 (FDI numbering system).  
- **Wisdom teeth status**:  
  - #38 (left maxillary third molar): Fully erupted, non-impacted.  
  - #48 (right mandibular third molar): Fully erupted, non-impacted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **#25 (left maxillary first molar)**:  
  - Suspicious for a root stump near the apical region.  
- **#24 (left maxillary second premolar)**:  
  - Areas of concern noted for suspected calculus.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- **#14 (right mandibular second premolar)**:  
  - Presence of a crown and root canal-treated tooth.  
- **#17 (right mandibular first molar)**:  
  - Crown and root canal-treated tooth.  
- **#35 (left maxillary first molar)**:  
  - Crown and root canal-treated tooth.  
- **#38 (left maxillary third molar)**:  
  - Crown, root canal-treated tooth, and multiple restorations.  
- **#45 (right mandibular first molar)**:  
  - Crown present.  
- **#46 (right mandibular second molar)**:  
  - Restoration detected.  
- **#47 (right mandibular second premolar)**:  
  - Restoration noted.  
- **#25 (left maxillary first molar)**:  
  - Root canal-treated tooth and restoration.

### **2. Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **#25**: Suspicious root stump and prior root canal treatment; requires clinical correlation for potential apical pathology.  
- **#24**: Suspected calculus; assess for periodontal involvement.  
- **#38**: Multiple restorations and root canal treatment; monitor for secondary caries or fracture risk.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols, emphasizing interdental cleaning for #24 and #25.  
- Monitor areas of suspected calculus (#24) during routine cleanings.  
- Advise patient to maintain regular fluoride exposure to reduce caries risk in restored teeth.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic and clinical evaluation of #25 and #24.  
- **Referral to endodontist** for #25 if clinical signs of apical inflammation develop.  
- **Periodontal assessment** for #24 to address suspected calculus and prevent progression.
