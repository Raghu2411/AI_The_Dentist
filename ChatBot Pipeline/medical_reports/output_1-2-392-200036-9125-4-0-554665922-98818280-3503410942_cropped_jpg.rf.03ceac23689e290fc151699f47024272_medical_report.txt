**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

1. **General Condition**  
   - A total of 31 teeth are clearly visualized, indicating a normal dentition with no missing or supernumerary teeth.  
   - All three identified wisdom teeth (#28, #18, #48) are present and **non-impacted**, with unimpeded eruption pathways observed.  

2. **Pathological Findings**  
   - **Tooth #36**: Suspicious for carious lesion in the mesial surface; requires clinical correlation.  
   - **Near tooth #47**: Areas of concern noted for caries on the distal aspect.  
   - **Near tooth #37**: Suspicious radiolucency consistent with early carious involvement.  
   - **Near tooth #18**: Potential carious involvement on the buccal surface.  
   - **Near tooth #36**: Additional radiolucency adjacent to #36, likely carious in nature.  

3. **Historical Interventions**  
   - No evidence of restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants detected.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

1. **Priority Concerns**  
   - **Deep carious involvement suspicious on #36** requires immediate clinical evaluation to prevent pulpal compromise.  
   - **Multiple areas of concern near #47, #37, #18, and #36** need diagnostic confirmation and preventive intervention.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Reinforce biofilm control through patient education on interproximal cleaning (e.g., flossing, water flossers).  
   - Apply fluoride varnish to high-risk areas to arrest early carious lesions.  

3. **Follow-up Protocol**  
   - **6-month recall** for reassessment of suspicious caries and progression monitoring.  
   - **Referral to general dentist** for definitive treatment planning, including restorative interventions for confirmed caries.  
   - **Digital radiographic correlation** recommended for clarity in diagnosing near-tooth lesions.
