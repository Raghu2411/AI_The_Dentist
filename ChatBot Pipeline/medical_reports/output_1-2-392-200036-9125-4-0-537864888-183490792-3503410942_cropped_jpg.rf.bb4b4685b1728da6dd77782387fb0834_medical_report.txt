**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  

#### **General Condition**  
A total of **19 teeth** are visualized within the panoramic field, with no evidence of visible wisdom teeth (teeth #18, #28, #38, #48). The dentition demonstrates partial edentulism, with missing posterior teeth in both arches.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
1. **Sign of root stumps** near tooth **#25** (multiple discrete lesions identified).  
2. **Impacted tooth** near tooth **#37** (angulated mesio-distally, no eruption into the occlusal plane).  
3. **Impacted tooth** near tooth **#16** (horizontal orientation, no visible emergence).  
4. **Root stump** near tooth **#16** (suspicious for residual root fragment).  
5. **Root stump** near tooth **#25** (additional lesion noted in proximity).  
6. **Areas of concern for root stumps** near tooth **#16** (low-confidence finding requiring correlation with clinical examination).  
7. **Areas of concern for caries** near tooth **#36** (minimal radiolucent alteration within the enamel-dentin junction).  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or dental implants are identified.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  

#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. **Impacted teeth** near **#37 and #16** require evaluation for surgical extraction planning.  
2. **Multiple root stumps** adjacent to **#25** and **#16** suggest prior extractions or non-vital remnants necessitating removal.  
3. **Suspected caries** near **#36** warrants clinical correlation and potential preventive restoration.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce meticulous interproximal plaque control, particularly near **#25 and #36**.  
- Schedule periodic radiographic follow-up to monitor stability of root stumps and impacted teeth.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for assessment of impacted teeth (#37 and #16) and root stumps (#25, #16).  
- **Recall in 3–6 months** for re-evaluation of carious lesion near **#36**.  
- **Annual panoramic imaging** to track progression of non-erupted teeth and residual root fragments.
