**Oral Panoramic X-ray Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  
1. **General Condition**  
   A total of 34 teeth are visualized within the field of view. All four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, and #48) are present and fully erupted with no evidence of impaction. No missing or supernumerary teeth are identified.  

2. **Pathological Findings**  
   No pathological abnormalities, including caries, periapical lesions, or impacted teeth, are detected in the visualized dentition.  

3. **Historical Interventions**  
   No prior restorative treatments (e.g., fillings, crowns, implants) or endodontic interventions are observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
1. **Priority Concerns**  
   No urgent clinical concerns are identified. All teeth demonstrate normal morphology and positioning.  

2. **Preventive Measures**  
   Reinforce patient education on daily plaque control and dietary habits to mitigate future carious risk. Emphasize interdental cleaning for posterior teeth.  

3. **Follow-up Protocol**  
   Schedule routine recall in 6–12 months for baseline monitoring. Document and re-evaluate wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) during subsequent visits for signs of pericoronitis or positional changes. No immediate intervention required.
