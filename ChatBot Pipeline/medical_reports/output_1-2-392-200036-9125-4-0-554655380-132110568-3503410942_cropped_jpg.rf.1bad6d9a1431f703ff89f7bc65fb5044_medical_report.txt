**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### Teeth-Specific Observations  

**1. General Condition**  
A total of 24 teeth are visualized within the panoramic field, with no evidence of wisdom teeth (third molars) present bilaterally. The dentition demonstrates adequate alignment and spatial distribution, though localized radiographic superimpositions are inherent to panoramic imaging limitations.  

**2. Pathological Findings**  
- Clear indication of a **root stump** is observed **near tooth #35** (left lower first molar), characterized by a residual root fragment with no coronal structure. This finding is consistent with a prior extraction or resorption event.  

**3. Historical Interventions**  
- **Tooth #16** (right upper first molar): Presence of a root canal-treated tooth with associated crown restoration.  
- **Tooth #13** (right upper second premolar): Root canal-treated tooth with a crown restoration.  
- **Tooth #47** (left lower third molar): A dental implant is visible, positioned adjacent to the mesial aspect of the first molar. No peri-implant radiolucency or complications noted.

### Clinical Summary & Recommendations  

**Priority Concerns**  
- **Root stump near #35**: Requires evaluation to confirm diagnostic classification and determine management (e.g., monitoring or surgical intervention).  

**Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce meticulous oral hygiene practices for the #47 implant site to prevent peri-implantitis.  
- Monitor adjacent periodontal health around restored teeth (#13, #16) for signs of secondary caries or marginal bone loss.  

**Follow-up Protocol**  
- **6-month recall** for radiographic assessment of the root stump (#35) and implant (#47) integration.  
- Referral to oral surgery is recommended for definitive management of the #35 root fragment.  
- Schedule a comprehensive periodontal evaluation to address potential calculus deposition, given the absence of visible calculus in current imaging but anatomical susceptibility in posterior regions.
