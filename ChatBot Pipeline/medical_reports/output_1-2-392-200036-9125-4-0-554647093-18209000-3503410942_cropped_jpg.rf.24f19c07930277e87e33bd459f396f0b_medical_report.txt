**Oral Panoramic Radiographic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **1. General Condition**  
Visualized 29 teeth (FDI numbering system) with normal eruptive sequence. All identified teeth demonstrate expected morphological features. Wisdom tooth #48 (left mandibular third molar) is fully erupted and non-impacted.  

#### **2. Pathological Findings**  
- **Sign of impacted tooth** noted near #17 (right maxillary first molar).  
- **Suggests impacted tooth** near #37 (left mandibular first molar) and **suspicious for impacted tooth** near #27 (right mandibular second molar).  
- **Suspicious for carious lesion** adjacent to #26 (left mandibular first molar).  

#### **3. Historical Interventions**  
No prior restorative, endodontic, or implant interventions observed.  

---

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
1. Impacted tooth near #17 requires evaluation for potential extraction.  
2. Suspicious impacted tooth near #37 and #27 necessitate clinical correlation for surgical planning.  
3. Carious lesion near #26 warrants urgent caries management.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce interproximal plaque control near #26, #17, #37, and #27.  
- Monitor suspicious areas for radiographic progression.  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **3-month recall** for caries assessment and impacted tooth evaluation.  
- **Referral to oral surgeon** for surgical extraction planning of impacted teeth near #17, #37, and #27.  
- **Dental endodontic consultation** if caries on #26 progresses to pulp involvement.
