**Oral Panoramic Examination Report**  

---

### **Teeth-Specific Observations**  
#### **General Condition**  
- A total of 32 teeth are visualized, corresponding to a full complement of permanent dentition.  
- All four wisdom teeth (#18, #28, #38, #48) are present and not impacted.  

#### **Pathological Findings**  
- **#28 (lower right third molar)**: Suspicious for a residual root fragment or residual root structure in the apical region. The finding remains inconclusive due to low imaging clarity.  

#### **Historical Interventions**  
- No evidence of prior restorations, crowns, root canal treatments, or implants is observed.

### **Clinical Summary & Recommendations**  
#### **Priority Concerns**  
- **Residual root structure near #28**: Requires evaluation to determine the need for surgical removal due to potential risk for infection or inflammatory resorption.  

#### **Preventive Measures**  
- Reinforce oral hygiene protocols in the posterior regions to mitigate bacterial accumulation near #28.  
- Monitor for signs of inflammation or mobility in adjacent teeth (#27, #37).  

#### **Follow-up Protocol**  
- **Referral to oral surgeon**: For assessment of the residual root fragment at #28 and determination of surgical intervention.  
- **6-month recall**: For radiographic reassessment and clinical evaluation of the lesion.  
- **Annual panoramic imaging**: To monitor stability of the residual root and surrounding bone.
